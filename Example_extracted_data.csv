"Today is exactly 1 month since I touched heroin (and meth but that's not an issue)","2022-01-12",1642012012,"Today is exactly 1 month since I touched heroin (and meth but that's not an issue)","Many of you have followed my journey and gave me much help, thanks to many of you I had times that month where I would stay off H for days. Even though now I'm still struggling with the heroin reddit has helped me a lot, I'm much more educated on the subject of harm reduction especially and psychological help you guys gave me.

How was 1 month of Heroin? Absolute hell, even though heroin itself makes me feel great the part of trying to find money for it, the fiending, going to the dangerous neighborhoods that the trap houses are, everytime risking getting robbed or even worse, ducking from the cops, switching buses everytime to not rise suspicion. The paranoia when getting heroin is crazy. 

Although I managed to find a way to start maintaining again relationships with friends and I'm starting getting on my feet again, that goes with spreading my heroin use every 2-3 even 4 days. 

Someone gave me a tip that I could do that and then end up only using like once a month or just recreationally without getting addicted. I'm not sure if I'm able to do that due to mental cravings but with my current ""technique"" I at least avoid physical dependence. I'm still working though on having a solid quitting plan.

As for meth, in 30 days I have only done 5-6 times probably. I just use it recreationally and have stopped doing binges. I mainly don't wanna use meth often because of the drug's toxicity. Now I'll only use if I'm with a drug friend, or alone for fun. Like for example I did yesterday after 2 weeks, I had more but didn't wanted to go on a binge so I had the willpower to not compulsive redose. Although today I did the leftover heroin and meth from yesterday and I'm speedballing (along with some pregabalin as well which is even better).

I am out of money now so I'm not sure when I'll buy Heroin again. Hopefully never but I don't think I'll manage it, maybe I will, today I got my klonopin and pregabalin scripts and in a couple days I'll get my ritalin prescription as well. That way I can get back on what my doctor had said on how much to take and get stable again.

It's been 1 month, I wanna thank you all for the help, even those who were ""aggressive"" in some comments, but even those people I know you have good intentions. 

This subreddit is like a safe place that I feel comfortable sharing whatever I'm experiencing, I've also met wonderful people here.  

Anyway that's all I had to say, thanks for reading. Stay safe y'all:)","Drugs",22,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/s2d6k9/today_is_exactly_1_month_since_i_touched_heroin/"
"Fibromyalgia and PIP","2022-12-05",1670250539,"Fibromyalgia and PIP","Hi all,

Probably a stupid question but hopefully someone more knowledgeable will know the answer; Ive been told I should apply for PIP but I dont think Im bad enough to be eligible?

Im M 38 and recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia after years of uncertainty which also got 1000 times worse after having COVID-19  (that would be normal for me with colds and flu but its stayed this time - now about 12 months )my current medication is pregabalin 3 times a day and although some side effect my pain is reduced I am always in pain, have issue with cold, get tired quicker than most people but not to the extent most notice as I try to hide it etc, I have trouble sleeping at time and I also get the fibro fog (although the meds make that worse and I seem slower mentally and if I ever miss one withdrawal is bad too), I know its limiting my work options (currently in universal credit and sell a few bits online to help ). 

I guess my question is when is pip a real option as it seems to be more for those with more severe symptoms which stop them doing anything at all, i dont want to claim what im not entitled to but keep being told I should (by people that dont really have any idea about  fibro or pip but want to help).

Ive tried a web search and the thread search but thought Id ask here as probably get a more realistic answer . Thanks for listening

&..so a fortnite ago I picked up 80 pregabalin 100s - they can come in handy - but typically, I ended up chugging them all and in 7 days they were gone. I hadnt had any preegs in years, so didnt think much of it. But Fck me, two days later I found myself having the worst withdrawal symptoms Ive ever had - and Ive had hella fkin plenty (from pharma Oxy - Im in the Uk and im prescribed them due to multiple cancers).

This shit was even worse than an Opi WD. Another day passed and my eldest daughter (my kids are all adults) popped round for a house call and found me unconscious on the floor. Called the paramedics - Id had multiple seizures, I had chronic hypertension, and my blood pressure (usually always on the low side) was sky high. Straight to hospital.  They sorted my shit out more or less (although to add insult to injury, Id also developed a urinary infection). 

But I felt like utter shit, every waking second - the only thing that remotely helped was my Oxy, which I chugged WAY too much of, and typically Ive run out early (they had a cannula in me which they used to dose me with 30mg of morphine every 8 hours - which obviously did bugger all, as Im prescribed 200mg Oxy IR daily).

Im  home now and clean outta Oxy. Im bricking it - after 6 days of hellish preeg WDs, now imma have to cope with 48hrs of Opi WDs until my script is ready=&.  Man.  Anyways, I remember I have half a bottle of fairly potent poppy seed tea in my cupboard - hurrah=

So now I find myself boofing shedloads of rancid PST up my shitter just to make these mad Opi WDs less agonising, and really, really hoping that I dont develop some weird rectal disease from boofing the worst smelling PST mud you could imagine.

"My Unexpected Pregabalin Nightmare","2022-10-23",1666532629,"My Unexpected Pregabalin Nightmare","This is a long one, and it might not go down well with aficionados, but I got burned through complacency. My tale of woe, as extracted from my book, might serve as a head-up for some people (or not). Be careful. .

EXCERPT FROM THE DRUG USERS BIBLE

First synthesized in 1990, pregabalin appeared on the market as a prescription drug under the brand name lyrica in 2005. It is used to treat a variety of ailments, including anxiety and pain.

Descriptions of its psychoactive effects vary somewhat. Whilst it is commonly classified as an anxiolytic, a sedative and a relaxant, I have sometimes seen references to hypnotic properties, and occasionally I have encountered suggestions that it can induce euphoria.  Despite the US government currently regarding it as having a low potential for abuse (Schedule V), it is clear that this is a serious recreational drug.

Regarding dosage, my initial inclination was to go for 450mg, but I subsequently found too many forum posts stating that sub-300mg doses were more than sufficient. \[e.g. 150mg gives me a nice little high while 300mg gets me crazy high \~Silenced, Bluelight.org\]. I found these hard to ignore.

Given that pregabalin was developed as a successor to gabapentin my expectations today are not great. I tested the latter a few weeks ago, and found it to be generally relaxing and calming but without anything in the way of uplift. I am also feeling a little washed-out and tired, which won't help matters.

&gt;T+0:00 I swallow a single 300mg capsule with a glass of water \[2.00pm\]  
&gt;  
&gt;T+1:00 Anxiolytic effects have emerged in the form of a comfort bubble, and a heady sense of well being. As I am not crazy high I pop another 300mg, to hopefully intensify proceedings.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+1:30 This is undeniably a nice benzo-like vibe, with a touch of inebriation. I feel warm and contented, with the headspace flowing here and there under a gentle dreamy sedation.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+2:00 At this point I am heavily inebriated and groggy. The dreamy headspace now carries a hint of nausea and some dizziness, to the extent that I lie on my bed for 15 minutes. This is rapidly becoming very uncomfortable and is definitely not pleasant. I soon hit the bed for a second time.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+ 4:30 The second recovery nap turned into a deep two hour sleep. I awoke feeling horrible: dizzy, groggy, and unable to function properly. I staggered to the bathroom, and then downstairs, trying to avoid contact with anyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;I place my head on my arms, lean forward and rest on the desk. I occasionally manage to lift myself up and struggle to type some words. Incredibly I am barely able to function. This is an awful experience and I wonder how much longer it will last. My fingers are trembling and I feel dreadful.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be in a public place in this state would be a nightmare. I would have to slump somewhere, appearing as a severely intoxicated drunk.  
&gt;  
&gt;I totally underestimated this drug.  I am basically zombified and largely mistuned to what is going on around me, which appears to be distant. My hands are numb and I am, essentially, stupefied, with head spinning.  
&gt;  
&gt;My efforts to browse the Internet for more information on pregabalin fail miserably: I am simply not capable. The excessive inebriation is way past the point of serious discomfort. Yes, I desperately want this to stop.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+5:30 Somehow I have just about managed to eat a pizza, which I ate almost mechanically to avoid making too much of a mess. This was a real challenge, but I got through it courtesy of the motivating thought that a bit of food might bring the unwanted-high down faster.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no doubt that any effort to hide my intoxicated state in a social scenario would still fail badly.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+6:00 I finally feel slightly less out of it, and I can just about type these notes without recovery breaks. It is far from easy, but I am able to sit up in my chair again without hunching forwards. Gradually I am integrating back into the normality around me.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+7:00 I am very much coming down; thank goodness. The dizzy inebriation can now be forced into the background with relative ease. I am quite stable again as I walk around, although I still feel generally woozy and not fully tuned back in to my surroundings, which have an unreal edge to them.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+7:30 I note that time seems to have passed rather quickly. This has been an extremely long ride in terms of the continued psychoactivity of this drug, but it doesnt seem like it. It has now evolved into a mild queasiness about the head and some disorientation, both physical and mental.  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout this, anxieties and worries have been generally absent. I might add though that there was a degree of anxiety at the peak in terms of the experience itself: this was worry about when I would recover and if I was actually okay. Yes, it was that intense.  
&gt;  
&gt;The inebriated headiness is now mild but is constantly present, and at times it can still be sickly and nauseous. I believe that I could now pass as sober again in a complex social situation, but I would have to concentrate to do so.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+8:00 The intensity continues to wind down, albeit very slowly. I am astonished that it hit so hard and I feel a significant degree of relief.  
&gt;  
&gt;T+8:30 At 10:30pm I am closing in on my usual bedtime. I expect a difficult nights sleep, not on the basis of the current effects of the drug, but because I slept for over two hours from 4pm.

Despite several wake-ups with a dry mouth, the nights sleep wasnt too bad. The next morning, however, I was still not fully with it and although I wasnt ill, I was not particularly well. I felt like I had a hangover but without the headache, and I was occasionally slightly dizzy and a tad nauseous. A sea-sickness-like feeling lingered for most of the day.

This one was a shock. I clearly took far too much and paid a price in terms of a strong intoxication which at times was extremely uncomfortable. I found myself struggling for some hours, hoping that the ride would wind down and end. Clearly a dose of 300mg or less would have been more than adequate.

Although this was a bad experience, it was an instructive one, from which the lessons are self-evident. If you use this drug be very careful with the dose, and of course dont make a habit of it. It can bite, and not in a pleasant way.","gabagoodness",47,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gabagoodness/comments/ybi2r8/my_unexpected_pregabalin_nightmare/"
"Information about Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Neurobiology and its Treatment","2022-02-22",1645489178,"Information about Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Neurobiology and its Treatment","***Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)***

*Social anxiety disorder involves pathological levels of anxiety in social or performance situations in which intense scrutiny by others is perceived or anticipated. Patients tend to altogether avoid the feared social situations; only approach them with a companion; or endure them with distress and physical symptoms that can approach the intensity of full panic attacks, such as flushing, sweating, palpitations, and tremor. Social anxiety disorder includes both a performance-only variant and generalized social anxiety disorder, which extends to a variety of social interactions.*

***Neurobiology of SAD***

*""As with PD and PTSD, amygdala activation has been implicated in symptoms of SAD. Social-cue tasks, such as the viewing of harsh faces, were associated with hyperreactivity in the Amygdala and other limbic areas in patients who had SAD. Similarly, in response to viewing negative (but not neutral or positive) affective faces, patients who have SAD exhibited bilateral amygdala activation, which positively correlated with symptom severity and which reversed upon successful treatment. In anticipation of public speaking, subcortical, limbic, and lateral paralimbic activity is increased in patients who have SAD, suggesting elevations in automatic emotional processing. Decreased activity in the ACC and PFC in these subjects suggests a decreased ability for cognitive processing. In contrast to the social-cue studies, activity in the left hippocampus and right amygdala was decreased during script-guided mental imagery tasks that provoke social anxiety. This decrease may reflect active blunting of the emotional and autonomic response to improve overall functioning during social situations that provoke anxiety. Furthermore, anxiety-provoking imagery (compared with neutral imagery) was associated with increased activation in the left postcentral gyrus and putamen and in the right inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri. Relative decreased activity was observed in the right middle temporal gyrus, left precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. After 8 weeks of treatment with nefazodone, both remitted and partially improved social anxiety was associated with decreased regional CBF (rCBF) in the lingual gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and right vlFC and with increased rCBF in the left middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal cortex. In subjects who achieved remission following nefazodone treatment, post treatment testing revealed decreased rCBF in the ventral and dorsal ACC, left vlPFC, dorsolateral PFC, and brainstem and increased rCBF in the middle cingulate cortex, left hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, subcallosal orbital, and superior frontal gyri. The combined results of imaging analysis in subjects who have SAD suggest dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamic network: hyperactivity in the right PFC, striatal dysfunction, and increased hippocampal and amygdala activity with left lateralization. It has been suggested that hyperactivity in the frontolimbic system, including the ACC, which processes negative emotional information and anticipation of aversive stimuli, could result in misinterpretation of social cues.""*

***Source***: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684250/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684250/)

*""The limbic-paralimbic system in the brain contains several structures, including the amygdala, locus coeruleus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, that are responsible for emotional processing and play a pivotal role in anxiety disorders. Heightened activity in these structures alters their functions. The role of the amygdala is to assess fearful or threatening stimuli, whereas the locus coeruleus signals the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, leading to release of the hormone. When the norepinephrine is released, critical parts of the autonomic nervous system are activated, leading to mood, cognition, and sleep adjustments as well as elevated heart rate and other hyperarousal symptoms. Traumatic memories and fear conditioning are housed in the hippocampus, and the hypothalamus mediates stressful occurrences. Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin are vital to the pathophysiology of anxiety. Patients who have SAD are likely to present with decreased serotonin, decreased dopamine, and increased glutamate. Pharmacologic agents used to treat SAD have mechanisms that act to regulate these neurotransmitters.""*

***Treatment of SAD***

*""According to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for SAD, treatment includes psychological and pharmacologic options. The psychological intervention termed cognitive-behavioral therapyÂ (CBT) is used to help patients face barriers directly through exposure techniques, relaxation techniques, and training in social and conversational skills. It is recommended that CBT be implemented ahead of pharmacologic therapy; however, some patients may decline it based on personal preference.Â Patients who manage their symptoms with psychological and pharmacologic treatments are more likely to achieve continued symptom-improvement benefits. Before pharmacologic agents are initiated, treatment options, expected outcomes, and possible adverse effects (AEs) of medications should be discussed with the patient.Â Following initiation, it is necessary to monitor treatment frequently in order to assess efficacy. Once the patient attains the desired therapeutic response, the medication should be continued for at least 12 months in order to prevent relapse.Â Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic drugs, benzodiazepines (BZDs), beta-blockers, and other anxiolytics are the standard drug classes used to treat SAD""*

### Psychotherapy of SAD

*Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a research-supported type of psychotherapy, is commonly used to treat social anxiety disorder. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations to help you feel less anxious and fearful. CBT also can help you learn and practice social skills, which is very important for treating social anxiety disorder. CBT has been well studied and is the gold standard for psychotherapy. Exposure therapy is a CBT method that focuses on progressively confronting the fears underlying an anxiety disorder to help you engage in activities you have been avoiding. Exposure therapy is sometimes used along with relaxation exercises. CBT delivered in a group therapy format also can offer unique benefits for social anxiety disorder. Another treatment option for social anxiety disorder is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). ACT takes a different approach than CBT to negative thoughts and uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce your discomfort and anxiety. Compared to CBT, ACT is a newer form of psychotherapy treatment, so less data are available on its effectiveness. However, different therapies work for different types of people, so it can be helpful to discuss what form of therapy may be right for you with a mental health professional.*

***Pharmacological Treatment of SAD***

#### SRIs

*Pharmacologic treatment aims to decrease anticipatory anxiety and avoidance behaviors before, and distress during, essential social activities to improve social and occupational functioning. Performance-only social anxiety disorder is generally not treated with maintenance medications because most people infrequently encounter the feared performance situations. The drugs in these classes that carry the FDA indication for social anxiety disorder include the SSRIs sertraline, paroxetine, and paroxetine CR as well as the SNRI venlafaxine XR. Data from RCTs also support the use of the SSRIs fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram (*[*97*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B97)**[*100*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B100)*). Some initial data support SNRI duloxetine for the treatment of social anxiety disorder (*[*101*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B101)*). Fluoxetine has less consistent evidence (*[*98*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B98)*,* [*102*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B102)*,* [*103*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B103)*). Escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine were shown in a meta-analysis to have roughly equivalent effect size and superiority to placebo (*[*104*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B104)*). Principles guiding titration and dosing are similar to those applied to generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.*

#### Beta-adrenergic blockers

*Beta blockers have been validated for the treatment of performance-only social anxiety, which generally arises in the context of public speaking or other performative situations. Their hypothesized mechanism of action is suppression of the physiological hyperarousal that occurs in the fear response to such situations. This process interrupts an escalating feedback loop in which patients become distressed and self-conscious about physical manifestations such as flushing, palpitations, and sweating, which subsequently causes them to further amplify these exhibitions; this amplification, in turn, begets more psychic anxiety about these manifestations being scrutinized by others and so on (*[*105*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B105)*,* [*106*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B106)*). For reasons that are not fully understood, beta blockers have not demonstrated efficacy in treating generalized social anxiety disorder. For instance, a head-to-head trial of beta blocker atenolol compared with the validated treatment phenelzine and placebo found atenolol ineffective for generalized social anxiety (*[*107*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B107)*). The nonselective beta blocker propranolol and the cardio-selective agent atenolol are the two primary agents that have been studied for use in performance-only social anxiety disorder. Recommended use is as needed 12 hours before a performance situation at total daily doses of 1080 mg propranolol and 50150 mg atenolol. One should take a test dose on a day with no performance obligations to get accustomed to the feeling of the medication. Typical adverse effects include orthostatic hypotension and lightheadedness, bradycardia, sedation, and nausea; in the case of nonselective propranolol, effects include worsening of underlying airway obstruction among patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (*[*105*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B105)*,* [*106*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B106)*,* [*108*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B108)*,* [*109*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B109)*).*

#### Benzodiazepines (BZDs)

*BZDs have moderate support in clinical studies for use in treating social anxiety disorder and are associated with a faster response than the first-line antidepressant agents (*[*110*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B110)*). Used as needed before performance situations or occasional feared social situations, BZDs may be quite helpful given their rapid onset of effect; however, they may also be associated with cognitive and psychomotor impairment and ataxia, which, in turn, could impair performance. A high incidence of patients with social anxiety disorder use alcohol to self-medicate symptoms. Thus, thorough substance use evaluation should be undertaken with all patients, and practitioners should carefully discuss risks and benefits of BZD prescriptions with patients who have histories of problematic alcohol use and document these conversations thoroughly. Concomitant use of alcohol with BZDs risks synergistic CNS depression, which could result in death (*[*111*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B111)*). However, if BZDs lead to significant improvement of social anxiety disorder symptoms, patients who historically have used alcohol to self-medicate for social anxiety may no longer feel compelled to do so. The available evidence suggests minimizing use of as-needed BZDs for generalized social anxiety disorder because rapid relief of anxiety with medication eliminates exposure to anxiety symptoms required for fear-extinction learning, interfering with the efficacy of CBT interventions (*[*112*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B112)*). For patients with refractory generalized social anxiety symptoms, standing BZD regimens may be appropriate, preferably with a long-acting agent initiated at low dose and titrated to the minimum dose needed for efficacy. In one study, adding 12 mg per day of clonazepam to flexibly-dosed paroxetine yielded superior results compared with paroxetine monotherapy (*[*110*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B110)*). For as-needed use, lorazepam given 12 hours before the occasional feared situation is a reasonable choice. As with beta blockers, patients naÃ¯ve to BZDs should first take a test dose in a safe setting to ensure toleration of the medication.*

#### Gabapentinoids

*Gabapentin and pregabalin both have RCTs showing efficacy over placebo for social anxiety disorder; however, it should be noted that improvement was associated with higher doses than are often tolerated (e.g., &gt;2,100 mg daily for gabapentin and 600 mg total daily for pregabalin) (*[*113*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B113)**[*115*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B115)*). However, one study supported slightly lower maintenance dosing for pregabalin (*[*114*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B114)*).*

#### MAOIs

*The MAOIs Phenelzine and Tranylcypromine formerly were regarded as the standard of care pharmacologic treatment for social anxiety disorder before the emergence of the safer, less complicated SSRIs and SNRIs. This practice was based initially on the observation that MAOIs seemed to uniquely treat patients with atypical depression and prominent rejection sensitivity; this practice was subsequently supported by multiple positive RCTs (*[*69*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B69)*,* [*73*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B73)*). The RIMAs represent a potentially helpful and easier to administer MAOI category for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, but limitations include lack of availability in the United States and mixed evidence (*[*79*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B79)*,* [*104*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B104)*,* [*116*](https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.focus.20200048#B116)*). Selegiline transdermal patch also lacks evidence for use in treating social anxiety disorder.*

"I have felt like I need to pee 24/7 for 26 years","2022-12-28",1672208366,"I have felt like I need to pee 24/7 for 26 years","TL;DR:  
*With no exageration I have felt like I need to pee 24/7 for 26 years. If you met me, you would never know. I believe I understand generally what is likely to be going on, but have been unable to resolve my symptoms. If youre someone who has had very similar symptoms or if youre a therapist who has helped resolve such symptoms, I would love to hear from you.* 

Throwaway account as Im somewhat known in other circles and dont want to be pitied/defined by this. In the business/corporate world, I also think this condition will be seen as a huge liability.

The point of this post is to see if perhaps someone else out there recognizes these same symptoms and has some insight that may help. Also to motivate anyone who has just developed symptoms to make recovering the focus of their life. There is a lot of info and help out there today compared to when my symptoms began and I believe that tackling this early on gives you a huge advantage. 

If youre just recently experiencing symptoms I dont want to freak you out with my story of 26 years of looking for an answer. If I was hit with these symptoms today, I would rule out the usual suspects with a few urologists and then if there is no obvious cause from the textbook urological perspective, I would immediately focus on muscle tension / pelvic floor muscles / nervous system relaxation. 

**PRIMARY SYMPTOMS:**

Most bothersome is CONSTANT urinary urgency. The sensation of needing to urinate **never** goes away. This sensation emanates from the tip of the penis NOT the bladder. 

The severity of this sensation goes from light to all encompassing where its literally impossible to think about anything else. Within a single day it can go from feeling pretty ok to so bad that its hard to function. When it flairs, it can last for days. I am not suicidal, but when its especially bad, I take comfort in the fact that we dont live forever. As soon as I urinate, the feeling of needing to urinate immediately returns. Usually the sensation becomes more intense in the afternoon and evening. I guess my brain knows somehow when I really need to go and when its just this sensation that I need to go.

Frequency - Usually at least once an hour. Sometimes many times an hour. However if on a good sleep and exercise routine, I almost always make it all night (8-9 hours) without needing to get up to urinate (more details below.)

**SECONDARY SYMPTOMS:**

Weak stream - Slow to get started. A weak stream once started. Much easier to urinate when sitting. When standing, especially in a public bathroom or even in a plane, I really have to strain and lean forward to get things started and from there the urine is just kind of dripping out. There is no force behind it.

Pain - there is an aching sensation in one area (perineum) ONLY after ejaculation IF I walk around immediately afterwards. If I lie still and wait 30 minutes or so, this pain is avoided. No other pain of any kind. No burning. No golf ball in rectum. No abdominal pain. No tingling. No numbness. No stinging. 

**HISTORY:**

Symptoms began at the age of 17 BEFORE I was sexually active. DURING self assisted ejaculation the urgency sensation turned on like a switch. I let go of my penis and said to myself oh fuck what have I done? For the next three months I didnt ejaculate at all, got a prostate exam, got a cystoscopy, took amitriptyline for a few weeks and was assured by the docs that there was nothing to worry about. All was declared normal. 

At some point the urgency sensation went away and I thought wow, what a crazy thing that was! and I went on with my life as normal. I ventured into self pleasure again and to my delight, I ejaculated with zero side effects. For 2-3 months I ejaculated daily and I completely forgot that I had ever had an issue. Then one day I was urinating and mid stream - boom, the urgency sensation hit me again and I knew in an instant that it was back. 

Its been 26 years since the day that sensation returned and it has not gone away. 

**AFFECT ON LIFE:**

I cant begin to describe the path this affliction has sent my life down. I basically have carved out a life around these symptoms, rather than living a life true to how I view the real me. I live a life that attempts to minimizes the intensity of the sensation of the constant urge to urinate. People assume my personality is something other than it is because they dont know the reason I make the choices I do. The few people who I have confided in simply dont get it because I look perfectly normal. I can not count the number of invitations to parties and dinners and lunches and overseas trips etc etc that I have turned down due to being in a flair or out of trying to ensure I dont cause a flair. 

Of course there is the financial burden too. Easily $100k over the years for various treatments and doctor visits. 

And then the psychological effect. Generally I like to think that you put out good vibes into the world and things will work themselves out. Ive had to face the rather unsettling reality that no, objectively bad things happen to good people. Im drawn to the Stoics view on the world, but no matter how I spin it, so far its been a big blow to my belief system and view of reality to realize that after 26 years I have failed in resolving this issue. When it first started I just naturally assumed that it would go away sooner or later - and it did - once. Then it came back and 26 years later I am realizing that there is a chance that this will never be resolved. Nevertheless, I am very determined to find a way to live the second half of my life without feeling that I need to pee 24/7.

**ABOUT ME:** 

In both cases (when symptoms began for the first time and then later returned), I was in an unhappy place in my life and felt a lot of shame/anger connected to lack of financial resources amongst a peer group that had plenty. I have never been good at expressing emotions and even if I feel angry or sad inside, you wouldnt know it. Im the cool, calm and collected guy - at least I appear that way. 

I am by nature generally a pretty happy and optimistic person, but 26 years of feeling like I need to pee has altered my personality and caused some depression/anger/anxiety. 

I am definitely predisposed to overthinking and analyzing, even when I was young before urinary symptoms started. 

Also predisposed to worry and catastrophizing. My brain often leaps to the worst case scenario like cant reach the wife, maybe she was in a car crash type of thing. 

Also predisposed to anxiety and panic, which seem to cycle in with the urinary symptoms and I dont know what is causing what. I know that a year prior to these symptoms started I had zero anxiety - you could put me in a window seat in economy for a 14 hour flight and I would pull out a good book and feel super comfy. 

I do remember a few isolated instances of panic when I was young before urinary symptoms started (over nothing in hindsight, but it was real to me then), but really the anxiety and panic has become much worse since these symptoms began. Without these urinary symptoms I have no idea if I would ever have developed the anxiety. 

Today, I get almost instant panic if I am in the back seat of a two-door car, in an elevator that stops for longer than usual, or in the middle seat or window seat on a plane. A few times just being on a plane has caused a panic and trapped sort of feeling, which always coincides with horrific urinary urgency. 

Outwardly, I look healthier than 90% of the population my age, but even if I can go to the gym for 90 minutes 5x a week, I dont have the energy of most unhealthy people. To feel normal I need 8-9 hours of sleep and I need to exercise regularly. One night out late will throw me off for a few days. 

Just a year before symptoms started I was an elite level rock climber and a top ultimate frisbee player. I was very active and never had any injuries aside from once falling on my back (see below.)

**CLUES:**

1. I fell on my lower back on a tile floor from a few feet about 6 months before symptoms started. I got up a little stiff and shook it off. Some docs think it may be relevant. 

2. While performing different stretches I can feel the pelvic floor muscles and my penis twitch uncontrollably. The puppy stretch is a good example. 

When I am in a relaxing position like lying on my back with my legs up on a pillow, this twitching of the muscles and penis will also often happen. Its to the point where you can visibly see my penis quivering and hopping around. It is not just something that I feel internally. 

3. At the same time the urinary issues started I was experiencing numerous incidences where I would bend over, get an electric shock feeling in my back and it would lock (this is at the age of 17). Just a year earlier I was super active with no physical problems whatsoever. 

At the same time, I started to get super tight and uncomfortable hip muscles, especially on the right side. The back and hip problems have remained to this day. Every couple of months I throw my back out and cant stand up straight or walk much. (At these times, I have full mobility leaning forward, but zero mobility leaning backwards.) Have to take Naproxen, ice and heat, and wait it out for 1-2 weeks. 

Even when its normal, activities like ironing and washing dishes cause my mid to upper back muscles to get so tight that I cant last longer than 5 minutes. At these times I use two massage balls to roll up and down the muscles either side of my spine and to roll around on my hips too and that seems to get me back to normal. I roll on massage balls multiple times a day to get the muscles to relax. It took me 10 years to figure this out. Prior to that I would just be in agonizing discomfort until eventually the muscles relaxed on their own.

If you paid me $10M to stand up and do an 8 hour shift as a cashier, I could not do it. Its a similar story sitting at a regular chair. I have a HAG Capisco chair with adjustable height desk, which is a life saver. I also work from home. I dont believe I could sit at a regular office chair and desk no matter how much you paid me. 

4. I can EXACTLY replicate and really exacerbate the urgency sensation in a couple ways:

A. when close to ejaculation if I try to delay 

B. if a PT with their fingers (or myself with a wand) pushes internally on the anterior portion of the pelvic floor muscles directly adjacent to the prostate and also if push directly on the prostate. This is the classic 1 oclock and 11 oclock that many PTs on YouTube reference. These two areas refer directly to the tip of the penis and putting slight pressure on them EXACTLY replicates and exacerbates the need to urinate sensation. There is no external muscle that you can manipulate to get this same response. 

C. No matter what, after ejaculation the urgency sensation is heightened and lasts at this increased level for at least 24 hours. Sex in the morning isnt worth it as the entire day is affected. This has become worse as I have gotten older. When I was younger I could go a few times in a night. Now after the first time, I have to lay still, take a hot bath, and sleep. Dozens of hours of the ramped up and non-stop sensation of needing to urinate far outweighs the rather temporary pleasure sensations of sex. 

5. Spicy food, salsa, chilis, tomato sauce, chocolate, sodas, dont have any effect on symptoms whatsoever. 

6. Coffee - especially hot coffee, THC, Psilocybin, Cocaine (tried a few times), Pseudoephedrine, Ritalin, and Modafinil are all guaranteed to ramp up frequency and urgency. With 50mg of Modafinil and a cup of coffee I could go 20 times in 3 hours. Obviously I rarely do this. 

7. Wine, beer, and ciders will cause an almost instant insane urgency and frequency to the point that I will be up all night and take days to recover. 

One or two drinks of rum or vodka initially has an effect of quieting the symptoms, but eventually causes a mini-flair, although nothing like beer, wine, and cider

(It has not always been this way. I remember a time when I would use a few glasses of red wine to actually help reduce the severity of the symptoms) 

8. Lack of sleep (anything less than 8 hours) will put me into a flair that could last days. 

9. Stress in general makes things way worse 

10. When I get anxious, nervous, or fearful, I can feel my pelvic floor muscles tighten. Also when I have these emotions, the urinary symptoms can become very intense. Even when I am watching an exciting moment in a sports game, I can feel these muscles contract in anticipation of a big moment.

11. Running and jumping feels like someone just pounding on my bladder. Riding a bike is fine and doesnt cause things to flair at all. 

12. Stretching my abdominals by hanging from a pull up bar and putting one leg forward and one backwards exacerbates the urgency sensation. 

13. Sex with her on top causes the urinary urge sensation to outweigh the pleasure sensations. The area above the bladder is extra tender in that pressing on it causes the urgency sensation to increase. 

14. No sexual partner has ever developed any symptoms. Ive been in touch with some for more than a decade. The chances this is a mysterious infection that came and went and returned again, but never infects anyone else seems to be zero. 

15. No issues with bowel movements. No pain. No constipation.   


**WHAT MAKES SYMPTOMS BETTER:** 

1. Just a few minutes in a super hot bath followed by lying down without moving. Even during major flairs, this will give me 20 minutes or so where I almost feel normal. 
2. I can also sometimes get the same relief lying down in the sun by the pool. It is very temporary - as soon as I get up and move around, the relief goes away. 
3. During a massage where I am somewhere between sleep and wakefulness I can often get this same relief. This lasts for a few minutes after the massage and then the urgency sensation rushes back
4. Diazepam 5-10mg takes the edge off, but doesnt make it go away. (Oral and suppositories)
5. Clonazepam (0.75mg with Remeron 7.5mg) every night for 10 years lets me sleep all night without having to get up even once. The exception is if I ejaculated prior to sleep, usually I will have to wake up to urinate once, but with the medication, I still get a solid 8-9 hours. Before I found this combo for sleep, I went years where I was up most of the night because its real hard to fall asleep when your body/brain is firing off signals that it needs to urinate! There were countless times where I began to dread the coming of night because I was in a flair and knew I would be unable to sleep. This medication has been the one thing that has changed my life for the better and allowed me to function. I am 100% dependent on the medication, but I have never had to increase the dose and thank God that at least I am able to sleep. 
6. When I need to have a bowel movement, often it greatly quiets the urinary urgency and frequency. Just a few days ago I traveled a few hours without hardly thinking about needing to pee. The whole time I knew I could go number 2 and I waited because it held off the urinary urgency and frequency. 
7. For a few moments after a bowel movement I feel almost completely normal. Then the urinary urgency sensation comes rushing back again. 
8. Generally, getting lots of sleep, exercising (lifting and cardio), and avoiding stress and life is manageable. Deviate at all and the intensity of the urgency sensation really ramps up. Exercise is especially important. It always makes me feel better and is a key part of breaking a flair. 
9. Quite often, when I get super hungry the symptoms are worse. Then I eat a big meal and symptoms are better. 
10. I look back and notice that during the times that I have been really happy in my life, the symptoms bothered me less and flairs were less common. 

  
**DIAGNOSTICS:** 

Nothing has ever been shown to be abnormal, except maybe number 9 below. I dont know if this means that everything is normal. For example, perhaps an MRI or X-ray wasnt taken from the correct angle or examined by the right expert. 

1. Visits to well over a dozen Urologists. I believe these to be some of the most useless and uncaring doctors on the planet. If you dont have bacterial prostatitis or an enlarged prostate, then surely you must be imagining it all! Thanks Doc!
2. Cystoscopy x 2
3. Urodynamics (showed that it takes me way longer than a normal person to urinate and that I really strain the muscles way more than normal instead of just relaxing like a normal person. But my bladder does fully empty.) 
4. MRIs examined by Urologist, Neurologist, and Chiropractor 
5. X-Rays
6. All kinds of blood tests including micronutrients and hormone panels 
7. Complete physicals 
8. Standard tests of stool, urine, semen, prostate fluid 
9. DNA test of prostate fluid and urine. Urine came back positive for Streptococcus Mitis. I took two courses of Cefotan, but symptoms didn't change. Doctors who I took the results to kind of dismissed this as probably being the result of a contaminant. 
10. Ultrasounds 
11. CT Scans 

**THINGS I HAVE TRIED:** 

1. Wise / Anderson Protocol. I did the in-person clinic and also had seen Tim Sawyer a couple dozen times a few years after symptoms began. For them its clear. I have trigger points adjacent to the prostate and I need to relax my nervous system. I did the protocol at home for 8 months pretty religiously. I would do the wand, a hot bath, and then the 45 min relaxation tapes. There were times during the relaxation that I felt almost normal. But as soon as I got back up and went about my day, the urgency sensation rushed back and I never got to a point where I felt overall I was better. I guess after 8 months I kind of gave up on it. Their opinion would be that I just need to continue the program for as long as it takes and if 45 minutes of meditation wasnt doing it, then increase it to 2-3 hours. I felt like if it was going to be the right thing, I would feel noticeably better after 8 months of the routine I was on. Perhaps I simply needed to continue for another year or two or three while increasing the time spent meditating. 
2. Dynamic Contraction Technique via David McCoid. I did at home for about 6 months. Never felt that I was getting reliably better, although I didnt have a lot of help with the assisted stretches. I understand Nic Bartolotta is the man and I hope to be able to see him in the near future. 
3. 90-day hard core anti-candida diet including no coffee or tea. Lost my belly fat, but no improvement of symptoms. 
4. Psychotherapy - always ended in lots of tears when asked to describe how I felt in my life around the time these symptoms began. So ok, I have some emotional block there. But if it was ever unblocked, it didnt lead to an improvement in my symptoms. Maybe its still blocked. 
5. Botox injections in muscles adjacent to prostate. (No improvement)
6. Nerve block - dorsal nerve of the penis. Successfully temporarily numbed my penis to external touch and thats all. Urgency sensation wasnt reduced at all. 
7. All of the below with no lasting improvement whatsoever:

**-Therapies:**

* Standard acupuncture 3 x weekly for months 
* Five element acupuncture x 50 sessions including needles in the the perineum 
* Deep abdominal massage x 30+ sessions 
* Chinese Penis massage (its a real thing) x 5 sessions 
* Jumping up and down for 6 hours a day x 10 days (its a real thing in Bali - google it)
* QSR PelviCenter electromagnetic chair 1 hour x 10 appointments (from Germany - I guess it helps some people)
* TENS unit on various parts of the body
* K-fit Kegel Toner Male Adapter in rectum
* Heated rectal probe - Germany again. 
* Massage therapy - hundred of massages - usually better during the massage and for a few minutes afterwards
* Craniosacral therapy - only a few sessions - usually felt better during the sessions
* Pilates for a few months. All poses extremely difficult for me. 

**-Medications/Herbs/Supplements:**

* Chinese herbs selected by numerous top Chinese docs usually focusing on kidney deficiency
* CBD oil
* Antibiotics - many, many varieties 
* Antidepressants (many, many kinds - maybe felt a little better temporarily, but nothing amazing and didnt last) 
* Alpha Blockers (almost all of them)
* Quercetin
* Pollen extract
* Bactrim
* Pregabalin and Gabapentin - I seemed to notice temporary relief early on that faded 
* Baclofen
* Tizanidine
* Morphine / Oxycontin / Codeine / Tramadol (Opioids dont help at all)
* Montek LC
* Atarax
* Cimetidine
* L-Arginine
* TRT therapy 
* HGH therapy 
* BPC-157, although I have no idea if what I paid for was legit 
* Microdose LSD 
* Miscrodose Psilocybin
* Homeopathics - doctor had me on like 20 different kinds for months
* Endless supplements and vitamins - I mean dozens upon dozens

For all the things I have tried, maybe I was on the right track but didnt do a given therapy long enough. Or maybe I had the right medication, but the wrong dose. There is no way of knowing. However, had I felt even marginally better I would have continued with the therapy/medication. 

**WHAT'S NEXT?**  
Currently I stretch a couple times a day and also use massage balls a lot. Regular hot baths too. I have struggled to keep a regular meditation routine. No excuses there. I'm in the gym with light weight and cardio 5x a week. My diet is good. I sleep 8-9 hours a night. Overall I am a very healthy person. But obviously something has gone wrong.

My back remains a regular issue. Usually just super tight and then often sprained to the point where I am out of commission and lying horizontal for over a week. This seems to happen 5-6 times a year. 

The same right hip that was super tight and uncomfortable when urinary symptoms began 26 years ago, remains so today despite endless stretching and heavy massage ball usage. 

I have been thinking about a heroic dose of Ayahuasca or Psilocybin - perhaps that would break the feedback loop that has been created in my brain/body. It may also just be a true nightmare as I have experienced with edible THC where the intensity of my symptoms increase dramatically. 

Have also thought about Ketamine therapy. And then have wondered if perhaps I just need to go back and start doing the Wise/Anderson protocol except dedicate double or triple the time that I did on my prior attempt. 

Where I am currently living, internal PT is not available. However, I have the wand from Wise/Anderson. I know the stretches that are good for me. I know how to meditate. Perhaps it's as simple as getting back into a routine and sticking with it for years. 

At this point I am really not sure as to what to do next. I know my muscles and nervous system are involved. I know that being able to replicate and exacerbate the symptoms pressing internally at 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock is a big clue as is temporary relief from a hot bath. But then I don't know why the efforts I made outlined above have not provided even slight permanent relief. Perhaps I have a structural issue on top of everything else and need MRIs conducted and examined by a true expert.

If you made it through this entire post, very impressive! Either you have experienced something similar yourself - I know how tough it is - or you are a therapist who has managed to help those who are suffering - I commend you! 

Either way  I would love to hear from you. I don't have it in me to just give up, so once once finances allow, I plan on traveling (or possibly even temporarily moving) to be near a person who is confident in their ability to help.","Prostatitis",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/zx2bf3/i_have_felt_like_i_need_to_pee_247_for_26_years/"

"How to study more effectively with N issues? Could memory issues be from Narcolepsy","2022-03-07",1646694398,"How to study more effectively with N issues? Could memory issues be from Narcolepsy","(Back story and rant) I got diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea around sometime last year or the year before that and have a CPAP.  Around July I got diagnosed with Narcolepsy (without cataplexy but I have been feeling a physical weakness in my fingers and my eyes &amp; head feel heavy when I do feel like I need to sleep).  I had an allergic reaction to Armodafinil, which the doctors thought not common because the reaction was in my mouth/gums and not spread or appeared elsewhere. As if they were confused or disappointed it didn't spread to my throat...I took the pill, an hour later my gums were on fire and itchy for 3-4 hours idk what else they thought it could be...
 So I was put on Sunosi next but that caused my anxiety and irritability to skyrocket through the roof. I was just pissed off at everything and for no real reason. Did not do well on that one. 

(Back to topic) Between the bad reactions to the medications, and the extreme fatigue from the narcolpesy I had to drop Organic Chemistry 1 to save my Genetics course. I got a C+ in Genetics, which is the lowest grade I've received in my Biology courses so far. I've received a B- or higher in the previous.  (Not counting Gen Chemistry 1 and 2 but I am not the best at Chemistry in general).  But it is getting worse as the courses are getting more difficult. I'm forgetting basic things I learned in Gen Bio 1 and 2.  I do care about low grades, but more about my ability to recall what I learned, and to apply to a job or career. 

My memory, focus, attention, and organizational thought/way of thinking has become a scattered tornado of confusion and it really worries me.  I can't stay awake to focus on studying, but when I do study for even 20-30 minutes and then take a short break, then go back to review what I just studied...it's like as if it was looking at the topics for the first time again. My brain is either in a foggy state of confusion or a state of super fast over-drive but without any organization.  Sometimes when I do have energy I feel like I can't do anything with it and will just feel frozen or as if I'm looking through the textbook or just staring at my notes without really getting what I wrote.  It is frustrating beyond belief and really wearing my moral and enjoyment in school down. I don't need extra time on exams, I need a better brain or memorizing/studying strategies. I record lectures which help a little. 

My doctor tried me on Adderall(d-amphetamine salt combo) 10mg in the morning and 10mg at noon, but it seemed to not help with the EDS a ton.  Even with the CPAP and a full night sleep I just have to nap/crash at least once or multiple times a day. You would think, oh I have trouble focusing and no attention span, adderall would help that. Nope.  So I am on day 3 (i think) of Adderrall 30mg Extended Release which seems to work a little better with the EDS, and I am not irritable and a bit less anxious, but the memory issues are causing frustration and are degrading my performance in school and life in general.  
Im trying my damndest to see a neurologist as soon as possible, but they seem at capacity so it looks like June at the earliest. I am also on amytriptlyne 75mg once at night for depression, and was on Abilify to help along side the amitriptlyne but the weight gain was *really* bad so I have finally tapered off it, going as low as I could with 2mg being the smallest dose before stopping it. Also on pregabalin for anxiety (75mg in am and 150mg at night).  I want to start getting off as many meds as I can, but I also work part time as well as college so I need time to adjust properly to each lower dose.


TL;DR  In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to study/focus better or to retain info better?  I'm in Animal Physiology and Evolutionary Biology currently failing animal phys. 

 Sorry this turned into a rant, but I just woke up an hour ago from a half-hour sleep paralysis hallucination-dream thing and it scared the heck out of me.  I *was* studying and fell asleep in my desk chair.  The plan was to grind straight from Fall 2021-&gt;winter-Spring-&gt; take Organic Chem 1 and 2 in the Summer-&gt;back to Fall 2022.

Edit: My school offers accomodations such as extra test time, taking exam in a quite room, and my professor for Evolutionary Biology has been kind enough to give me extended dead lines for assignments and research projects.

But, I never feel like I need extra time or a quiet room for exams because I either I know it or don't for lack of a better word. Extra time for assignments is great, but I just feel like I need a new brain or the memory center of my brain is just collapsing in on itself. I'm noticing more and more I am taking extra time to even remember how to spell basic words. For example, I feel a literal strain to remember how to spell words or recall definitions. And it is happening more and more.","Narcolepsy",23,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/t928jk/how_to_study_more_effectively_with_n_issues_could/"

"Woke up with Tinnitus a month ago, later realised I have sound sensitivity too. need help figuring out its cause &amp; treatment","2022-08-13",1660407762,"Woke up with Tinnitus a month ago, later realised I have sound sensitivity too. need help figuring out its cause &amp; treatment","I woke up with a high-frequency eeeeeeee sound (around14khz) in my left ear on 15th July. I don't know how it happened, I wasn't exposed to any loud noises around that time. I was 7 months into my long covid at that time which started in Dec from Vax+Covid (Symptoms were CFS, heart, lungs, and gut issues). I was ~70% better at this point but this now tinnitus is making me insane. This is my 3rd long covid and I recovered from the last 2 within 3 months.

Went to an ENT specialist, and he checked my ears, they were clean, with no sign of infection. Taken audiometry test, No hearing loss. Dr said the test doesn't have a test for freq. higher than 8khz so if there is damage to some higher freq hair cells in the ear, That can cause tinnitus. Although later I checked with good quality headphones and an online hearing test at home, my hearing is fine and I can hear up to 19khz.

He Gave me Meds for 3 weeks (caroverine 20 mg, Cinnarizine 15mg +Domperidone 20mg) but these haven't made any difference. I have tried antibiotics, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory drops as well.

I now realize I have sound sensitivity as well, whenever I hear sounds more than 60db for a few mins my ears start hurting and the pain then radiates to my jaw. Tinnitus gets louder as well. This goes on for hours from just a few mins of sounds. Normal sounds like a fan, talking, etc don't affect me.

I don't know what is the cause behind this, is it a covid effect? My Mum was having a high fever a week before that, I didn't but I had omicron in April. I took pregabalin 75mg on the 13th (i have used this med many times before without any issues) can that cause Tinnitus? High cholesterol because of covid might be a reason? Wisdom tooth which is growing weirdly for more than 6 years now? Postural cervical spondylosis? (which I have for more than a decade now and doesn't cause problems if a exercise and keep good posture) Insulin resistance? (my HBA1C is normal though)
or simply because of my daily earphone usage of 4-5h? I knew the dangers of loud music already so I always kept it below 50% volume and never went above 70%. But maybe my ears are weakened because of long covid just like my other body parts did.

I have tried many vitamins and supplements for it as well, and so far I found some that decrease the volume of my Tinnitus temporarily for 5-6 hours and those are zinc acetate 50mg &amp; NAC 500mg. Magnesium doesn't make any difference, and coffee/salt doesn't spike the volume. White noise etc makes my Tinnitus go louder, silence makes it better. Rosuvastatin also lowers the volume for a day.

Kindly advise me on how to treat it, I'm out of ideas only prolonged fasting is left to try. Drs are useless (I've known this for years) because I had to treat myself out of the Long Covid. I intend to do the same for Tinnitus &amp; sound sensitivity.
Kindly suggest supplements for hyperacusis (sound sensitivity) as well.","tinnitus",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/wniebj/woke_up_with_tinnitus_a_month_ago_later_realised/"

As i was finishing up the joint at around 11pm my whole body started to vibrate and my eyes were bloodshot red, as i lied on my bed and started listening to songs (ah yes they sounded amazing), there were waves of euphoria throughout very similar to mdma like and i was continuously smiling and laughing even at the smallest things.

The best part of it was the closed eye visuals, anything that i was thinking of i could see very clearly when my eyes were closed, this was my first time experiencing this so i was just enjoying it the whole night and slept at around 4am, there were a few times when i could feel that i would passout when sitting upright but the songs at full volume kept me awake.

# BACKGROUND

Ill write a quite detailed background, but I bolded each infusion report, so you can easily skip this if you want and go for the more interesting part =B

Anyway&

(M) 27 years old, from Italy.

All my problems stems from the believe of being a defective human being that is deeply rooted inside myself since I was a kid, that filters and distorts a lot of my mental processes and it is always there.

But the real trouble began in May, after a bad trip on weed and a rejection from a girl I had a relationship with months before.

After that events my nervous system crashed.

I started to be stuck in weird obsessive thought loops, stuck with intrusive thoughts about my defectiveness 24/24, all didnt make sense anymore, I believed I was a subhuman, perceiving with limited mental abilities and capability of perceiving reality.

My mental illness or my sense of defectiveness just overflown. I felt over depressed suddenly, anxious, stuck.

I remember thinking  I cant believe it, this is happening again I knew what was going to happen and that I had no control. This same weird mental experience happened when I was 19.

The thoughts I had about my defectiveness took the delusional root. The same believes I had when I was 19 overflown again. When I was 19 I thought about having an undetectable brain disorder that couldnt be identified from normal tests, and that also my cousin got this disorder. I wanted to find the cause of this, I wanted to have a brain scan, I did an IQ test and so on.

It was happening again.

It was very traumatic this time, I couldnt let it go and my nervous system crashed. The following days I went from manic to super depressed and catastrophic within the same day. Then suddenly I got an anxiety attack, and from that day I started to have catastrophizing thoughts: I would wake up in the middle of the night with a sharp pain in my chest and burning skin feeling that my life was over and death was near the corner. I started to have weird physical symptoms: constant muscle twitches, burning skin, nausea and my body was giving me shocks when I tried to relax.

I really didnt know what was happening to me, I couldnt believe it was possible to suffer so much only because of your mind.

I felt desperate, hopeless, I spent days obsessively ruminating, trying to find an answer and a solution to what I was experiencing. I spent a lot of time seeking information online.

I got overmedicated for months: 100mg fluvoxamine, + up to 3/4mg a day of lorazepam to calm the anxiety a lil bit, and pregabalin to discontinue then the lorazepam.

The big sad and the immense anxiety started to fade the next months. Anxiety, burning skin and body jolts almost disappeared in September. Also muscle twitches reduced (but I still have them to this date, around 7 months after the traumatic event)

Then what was left of me was just emptiness, emotional numbness and apathy to this date.

I dont have this intrusive thoughts now, probably because of the medication that partially is doing its job but its numbing every part of me.

# KETAMINE CLINIC PL

I scouted and contacted different ketamine clinics in Europe, like Awakn clinics, Psyon, Ovid Clinic, etc& but I decided to go for KETAMINE CLINIC PL in Warsaw (Poland) as the other clinics were overpriced. Had an initial evaluation with the psychiatrist who decided I was a good candidate for ketamine therapy, so I made the payment of around 6000PLN (1300 eur) for a package of 6 infusions + 3 integrations sessions with a therapist. Infusions were scheduled from 23 Nov to 9 Dec, every Wednesday and Friday.

# 

# #1 INFUSION - DISAPPOINTMENT

I wasnt particulary anxious about the treatment. I also brought a mantra with me if things could get bad during the trip, as I prepared at the first online session with my integration therapist. Treat it like a dream. Whatever will happen, it will come to an end in 40-60 minutes.

When I arrived at the clinic, I met with a young psychiatrist that made me sign the informed consent to go start with 40 mg (slightly more that 0.5mg/kg as I am 75kg). She seemed a bit unexperienced, but still, she was very warm and made me feel comfortable and safe. So I was laying down on the clinics bed, wearing blankets, eye mask, headphones and I was ready to start.

Infusion started, and for the first 10-15 minutes I was noticing nothing was happening. I started questioning if nothing was happening was because my brain is defective and damaged. Suddenly, I was facing two of my monsters, that were playing together potentiating their effect against me.

From one side, there was that deep sense of being defective, as ketamine wasnt doing anything much, I thought This is the proof that Im profoundly broken, defective and different, I dont even react to drugs like normal humans would

From the other side, this not perceiving a lot of effects from ketamine fueled the belief that I fried my brain with psychotropic drugs, and this was the proof of the damage, and that I will be numb and flat for the rest of my life.

During all the experience I was also switching from identifiying myself with these thoughts, to become more aware and distance myself from them. Sometimes I understood that this wasnt true and it was only the dark side of my mind that was tricking me. But soon again I was forgetting about this realizations and I was back in fully believing this thoughts.

Despite this catastrophic thoughts at the same time the experience was relaxing, even if this doesnt make sense considering what was going on my mind.

The experience was very mild and disappointing, I had too many expectations, I was expecting to see stuff, see the trauma and have epiphanies, but ofc that wasnt the case.

# 

# #2 INFUSION - BLISSFULNESS

Drank a lot of green tea when I woke up in the morning and ingested my magnesium l-threonate 30-40 min before the infusion (I got a magnesium capsule before every infusion). I had a little bit of anticipatory anxiety this time, maybe I was fearing I could dig too much inside my mind and get injured, as I had planned a dosage increase. Went from 40mg to 55mg. A subtle change, for a completely different experience. This time I changed also music, I went from trippy-progressive kind to a zen soundtrack with nature sounds, which I think impacted my trip positively.

When the infusion started with some grounding and calming breathing exercise for like 5-10 minutes (inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 7, exhaling for 8) until the ketamine started to make its effect. I felt very relaxed and open-minded, ready to explore anything that could happen. There was no inner critic this time, my mind felt light, present and peaceful. I had a mantra with me: Anything will happen, you are safe.

Then the K hit strong. Way more intense than the first infusion. I started to feel my body and perception of the outside world melting, as everything in my consciousness became deeply black, like I was sinking in a new reality. The journey started, I felt I was floating in space inside this capsule that was protecting me, visiting different perceptions of reality. I had no visuals, it was like experiencing this different realities in shades of grey and with like a sixth sense. Really hard to explain. I dont know if this was a k-hole, but it felt like, even if I maintained my sense of self, and I still knew I was in the clinic, even if my body and the reality felt very distant from where my mind was. During all the trip I reminded myself that I was safe. And I felt that way. It was a journey inside my mind, all the time peaceful, relaxed, as I was able to let go of everything. I even remember I thought that if Id die in that precise experience it was fine, I accepted everything, there was no fear.

Unluckily this afterglow of inner peace and profound calmness lasted like 1 hour after the infusion, where I was slowly back in my inner sense of emptiness and emotional flatness. But this time I was less disappointed about this, even if there still was a bit of it. But it was still a very meaningful experience, as for the first time I was able to let go and accept everything, I felt safe again and I wasnt scared about digging into my mind.

Felt nauseous and about to throw up for a big part of the remaining day.

The days later I felt more depressed. On Sunday I wasnt able to leave the bed in the morning. And I also started to experience a constant state of mild-anxiety.  I woke up every morning the following days with anxiety, and I was sleeping very suboptimally.

I was reassured from my therapist and psychiatrist, that a spike in anxiety after the first 2-4 infusions was common and normal, so I tried to attach on this.

# 

# #3 INFUSION - BAD TRIP

I did 2 big mistakes the morning of the 3rd infusion: on was not taking a break from work, phone and duties the day of the infusion. The second was that I got call from my boss that I did a huge mistake, so I spent a couple hours in the morning handling this problem.

I was in a negative mindset after this event, And I also felt overheled, as a lof of work was expecting me in the following months.

I wasnt able to clear my mind, It was full of work-related negative thoughts. At one point I was starting to believe I needed to quit my job as I wasnt in the right mental space to handle everything.

Did some meditation before the infusion, but my mind was still negative, full, and worried.

I also forgot my eye mask this time, and so I used 2 covid masks as a replacement for it.

Infusion started (dosage 60mg), and worsening the situation was the fact that my blanket wasnt covering my feets (and I dont know why I didnt ask the doc to cover me fully), and the doctor forgot to put the pressure belt on my arm.

These 2 things seem very tiny problems, but they contributed for sure in the negative experience that followed, and in the feeling son unsafety.

I was worried I could be cold because of my feet, and like doc forgot the pressure thing, now what will happen?

When the trip started I wasnt feeling safe like the last time. As music this time I used Hopkins University Psychedelic Playlist but it took a negative connotate during the trip. When the k hit, my mind was starting to spinning, I was feeling like I was losing control, but this time there was no acceptance. I started to get unpleasing visuals, like serial killers, monsters, and other weird stuff that probably disturbed me in the past.

I was feeling overhelmed, my thoughts also were confusing, I had vertigo. I felt like I was going deep in some sort of disturbing hell. And that impeding sense that my life was near the end was there again. The same feelings that I had when all this hell started in May and I was waking up at night with this doom of my life being over, and death near the corner.

At one point I felt like I was being buried alive. I wasnt ready to die.

I also started to believe that the doctors at the clinic noticed I was dying and they were in emergency mode trying to rescue me.

After the trip ended, the doc asked me if I was ok, everything still felt distant and I wasnt able to talk so I just moaned. Slowly I regained my the control of my body, I went from lying to sitting and I started to stare in the void like an absent-minded. I felt confused and very disturbed. I didnt know what to do. The experience was debilitating.

I felt unsafe and I started thinking maybe ketamine wasnt for me, and that I was developing paranoia or psychosis.

I called a taxi to go back to my apartment. Luckily this disturbed feelings subsided the moment I took an hot shower and journaled about the experience.

Lesson learned: Mindset is very important, as the altered state of consciousness amplifies your current mental state and your feelings. So the days of the following infusions I assured I had a blank mind and avoided any work or distracting activities.

# 

# #4 INFUSION - TOTAL APATHY

I started with a calmer mind than the previous infusion. Dose up to 65mg. But I dont remember a lot about this one. Disassociation, some weird perception as always, but at some point some numbness/indifference took place, I remember I was starting to think I dont care and Fuck everything, like I dont care if I die now, I dont care if Ill be stuck forever in this trip, I dont care about this treatment, it isnt working, I dont care about integration. I was thinking that Ill be this numb and anhedonic forever so nothing matters at all. I stopped even paying attention to the trip itself because of this carelessness, and in fact I dont remember much out of it. I felt relaxed and didnt have anxiety during this infusion. When I woke up I felt disappointed, aphatetic and void. I was thinking that if this is the effect after 4 treatments I am not responding, ketamine is not working for me.. I felt calm but apathetic, during integration I had to force myself to talk because I had no interest in doing it.

From this session I started to even feel more indifferent and careless. But also the anxiety that surged after the 2nd infusion was gone. The fear of death was gone too.

Had some passive suicide ideations the same day and the following. Death didnt seems so bad anymore. The  thought of jumping in front of a running train wasnt scary at all. But luckily they were just passive thoughts.

When I was going back to my apartment in public transport I almost started crying, I needed to do it too feel some sort of liberation, but I repressed it since I wasnt at home..

# 

# #5 INFUSION - REBIRTH

Came to the clinic this time with a relaxed attitude. Still flat and hollow, but relaxed. No expectations. I asked to have an higher dose and we went from 65mg to 75mg (so 1mg/kg). Double blanket, eye mask, meditation healing music, some diaphrammatic breathing and here we go. I had some mantras that I was repeating in my head at the beginning of the infusion, and also journaled about it before that.

May I be safe

May I be free from depression

May I be free from suffering

May I be able to feel again

I was letting go of everything too, letting the ketamine do its job of flushing all the junk out of my mind. I visualized this purification act and that the substance was flushing out every neuron in my brain.

During the trip I felt like I was traveling to the unconscious, I saw some staff buried in it, but I was calm and I was fine with everything. The music was perfect, I also started a journey to exploring the unknown and felt that I was going near to this ketamine multiverse. Visuals and weird kinetic perceptions and experience followed all along the trip. I was again at that blissful and luminous train station I saw during the 2nd infusion. It felt like I was near to the portal that leaded to the truth of everything, or some form of afterlife and I was really near it. I could feel some supreme entities being there.

I felt free and enriched by blissful wise. I felt acceptance of everything.

This exploration journey continued, but at some point I started noticing my tinnitus. Ive never thought about how I could experience tinnitus on an altered state of consciousness. It started to be really loud, I thought I was now trapped in that state forever with that loud madness-inducing noise. Rough anxiety emerged, all the blissfulness evaporated, and also the visuals morphed and somewhat zombified, the music sounded different. I was afraid the anxiety could overwhelm me again& but I dont know how but I was able to get back in that state of blissfulness, and the anxiety and the dark visuals were gone. I was arriving at the end of the trip, I started to feel my body more, but I lost perception of time and space, I saw some light coming through my eyemask, and I thought it was the sunrise, and it really felt like I was reborn. I realized somewhat later it was just the lamp of the clinic.

I chilled 1 hour ore with music in-ear and eyemask, still and trying to reflect and let the experience sink in.

Felt very calm and collected afterwards, but still very aphatetic, robotic and flat.

But i felt wiser.

# 

# #6 INFUSION - CONFUSION

I had the same mindset of the last infusion: apathetic but very calm, anxiety-free. I spent the morning before the treatment without any phone or distractions.

Right before the infusion I journaled some intentions: this time I didnt aim to be free from apathy and be able to feel joy and feel live again, as didnt work in the last infusion. I set the intentions to be free from suffering, be free from the desire to feel again, as this cause suffering and be free from the belief that I will be in this apathetic state forever, and that there is hope. This intentions sounded way more realizable to me.

We went for 85mg. This experience was a little bit weird. As usual I started to do some 4-7-8 breathings, aiming to do it for 10 mins till the beginning of the trip. But the K hit hard suddenly, and I quickly forget what I had intended to do. I wasnt yet properly mentally prepared for the trip. I spent some time in this total blackness, with partial disassociation, but I was still aware of my surroundings, but I was somewhat confused. Nothing was happening, no visuals, nothing and I started to questioning if I built tolerance or if my brain was fried from ketamine. I hadnt any revelations or particular journeys, most of the time I was confused, I had in mind that I had to do something, then I remembered that I had to surrender to the experience and not have expectations. But suddenly I was in that confusion state again and I forgot again my intentions, what I was doing there, if this thoughts were real or it was just my mind tripping. The central theme of my 6th infusion was like Is my brain permanently damaged?

It is a belief Im trying to challenge so hard lately, that I will be in this apathetic state forever and that there is no hope for recovery. Ketamine didnt help in this and that is hindering my recovery. I feel like this apathy, complete indifference to everything feels like brain damage, both induced by all the suffering I experienced the last year, and both meds-induced.

Near the end of the trip I had some near-death experience, as I felt that my brain was being fried even more, I visualized my brain in blood, and it felt like it was the end for me. This time I felt some anxiety, I wasnt ready to die. Luckily this weird experience vanished after some time, and I went back to a blissful and still state. This ketamine experience felt like it lasted very short

After the infusion I was still apathetic, but a peaceful kind of

# 

# ENDING REFLECTIONS

So i came to the end of this journey.

I am still apathetic and numb, I still feel mostly nothing, no joy, no motivation, no excitement. But I feel way more lightweight and calm.

There is more acceptance. Maybe after all I experienced, this is still not the time for me to feel joy and emotions, maybe I still need more time and recovery. Im trying to be attached to the interpretation my integration therapist gave about of my state: Maybe feeling empty and nothing is necessary: weights and junk have been removed from your mind, leaving some space. Some space that now feels like a big void, but its a space that can be filled with new things.

So at the end I think I benefitted from this therapy, even if not in the way I imagined&

I thought it could fix me, that ketamine could make me feel joy, motivation and give me back my old self. That wasnt the case. I still feel like the ghost of myself. But since the 5th infusion I think now there is a new starting point for me. There is maybe hope. I can still go forward. Maybe I will be able to feel live again, maybe not.. but somewhat there is acceptance in any case.

At the moment anxiety is gone. I feel fearless. Actually I no longer feel like my life is at the end, and that the death is behind the corner.

I also think that some rigid thinking patters and no-hope beliefs I build during this period of suffering have been cleared, my mind seems unchained. I gained wisdom.

I would have wanted to continue with the infusions, but its time for me now to back to home for now.

# 

# NEXT STEPS

I need to go forward, despite still feeling so indifferent and numb. There is a part of me that since ketamine didnt help with this apathetic state of mind thinks that this is like persistent brain damage. Like if ketamine didnt touch this and didnt help, I am not sure what else will. But maybe only time will fix.

Anyway my next step is to finally start tapering the fluvoxamine, a med I really regret taking, as it made me more flat and it is very contributing to this belief of being now brain-damaged, hopefully starting to be able to feel something again, and not being totally bland. But having persistent induced-apathy from this medication is a possibility&

At the clinic they suggested me to go on a MAOI, moclobemide. But honestly I would like to avoid other psych meds for now& After discontinuation of the SSRIs I will give microdosing shrooms a try. Also shrooms macrodoses and MDMA guided trips are on my future list.

So I hope you found my sessions report useful, feel free to ask me any question if you want! Wishing you good ketamine experiences to all the community =B","TherapeuticKetamine",18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/TherapeuticKetamine/comments/zhn594/complete_6_infusions_report_helped_but_not_the/"

"3","2022-07-17",1658084159,"100 Regimens From MAOI's to See What Most Common Adjunct in to MAOI's","So, I decided to pick 100 regimen's from this subreddit from posts I've never seen with the word ""MAOI regimen"" ""MAOI adjunct"" or ""MAOI combination"" to see what the most common adjuncts and MAOI's were that y'all use. I used 100/3500 user's regimens, about 2.85% of users. These included regimens with two MAOI's in the regimen as well, those being Moclobemide + Selegiline, Tranylcypromine + Moclobemide, Tranylcypromine + Selegiline, and Phenelzine + Tranylcypromine. Weirdly, Isocarboxazid was only in a fraction of my sample, comparatively to Phenelzine and Tranylcypromine, but it is not as widely used so that might make sense. Also, the amount of stimulants used were also pretty high, but it would make sense because they are widely used for TRD and there are many people with comorbid ADHD, anyways enough babbling from me. These were my results:

MAOI's-

46% of regimens included Tranylcypromine, with a mean dosage of 49mg, a minimum dosage of 7.5mg, and a maximum dosage of 90mg.

43% of regimens included Phenelzine, with a mean dose of 65mg, a minimum dose of 30mg, and a maximum dose of 120mg.

11% of regimens included Selegiline (Oral, Sublingual, and Transdermal), with a mean dose of 12mg, a minimum dose of 2.5mg, and a maximum dose of 40mg. For Selegiline I feel responsible to say the dosages because of the different ways of consumption, so here they are: 1x 2.5mg, 1x 5mg, 3x 6mg, 3x 9mg, 1x 12mg, 1x 20mg, and 1x 40mg.

5% of regimens included Moclobemide, with a mean dose of 270mg, a minimum dose of 150mg, and a maximum dose of 300mg.

4% of regimens included Isocarboxazid, with a mean dose of 75mg, a minimum dose of 60mg, and a maximum dose of 90mg.

"4","2022-12-18",1671343596,"Panhandling, how I do it and how I feel bout it","I usually go to the center of city where thousands of people are. I have social anxiety so that means I need to be high when I do it, also I kinda feel ashamed. I would make even 20 euros in 30 mins on a good day. More than enough. 

I usually go like ""excuse me, do you have a spare .80 euros to buy cigarettes?"" If they seem willing I tell them ""I was in a rush and left my wallet so yeah"" 

The reason I say specifically 80 cents, is cause people rarely start counting coins and they just wanna go to whatever they want so they give me like 1 or 2 euros, sometimes .50 but rarely. Once and elder man gave me all his coins which where almost 4 euros.

Usually I would go to my plug ask for some H cause I'm sick. They usually give to regular customers. After that I get social and no shame at all. I then make more than 10euros go back and buy.

It's now 8am, got no sleep cause I was up for like 80 hours on stims, crashed and slept for more than 15 hours waking up at 8pm. I'm debating on going for panhandling or not, i'll probably go at 10am cause it's the time with most people and right now everyone's getting to their jobs, are in a rush etc. I've panhandle more than 20 times yet that shame won't go away.

I'm also on a fucking huge pregabalin dosage stumbling around, but I really need that fix.

"9","2022-06-24",1656077592,"Long time RLS sufferer here. Some tips I've learned along the way.","Dunno why I just thought about seeing if there was an RLS subreddit. I'm up after a terrible night of RLS keeping me from sleeping once again. Wanted to share some info as someone who has dealt with this for decades now. 

First off, I'm 44(M). Have a family history of RLS and dealt with it for the past probably 25 years. It sucks. I hate it. I get it throughout my entire body. Sometimes my arms, sometimes my legs, sometimes the arch of my foot. Sometimes my knees. Quality sleep is something I know nothing about and I can sympathize with everyone here. Those that don't suffer from it don't really understand. I have no clue what it's like to close my eyes, sleep and wake up rested. I get 5 hrs of sleep most nights but that's broken up by waking up 5-6 times throughout the night. The point is... I feel you. I sympathize. 

I've tried just about everything to deal with this. Those that say avoid things that make you sleepy are correct. Benadryl is the devil. Melatonin is the devil. My wife is sympathetic to my RLS but she thinks it's akin to insomnia and tries to find ways to help me fall asleep. Falling asleep isn't the main issue (sometimes it is), it's staying asleep for more than an hour or two. 

After a decade or so of dealing with it I finally went to the Dr for it hoping for relief. They were understanding. Got a prescription for Gabapentin. It worked... for 2 nights. I kept taking it hoping it would help and I suppose it helped a little but it wasn't the miracle cure I was hoping for. Still suffered symptoms, still up in the middle of the night, but maybe not quite as much? Issue is side effects. Groggy the next morning, slight mood changes etc. I don't like taking medicine and eventually it just stopped working. 

Talked to Dr again. They gave me Pregabalin to try. That caused insane insomnia for me and didn't help. Gave up on the medicine route. I stopped Gabapentin and Pregablin awhile back and I'm glad I did. 

I've tried magnesium, I've tried potassium. I've tried iron supplements. None of those seem to help for some reason. 

So what does help? For me a couple things. YMMV but this condition SUCKS and if we can help each other find something that works then that's a win. 

3 things help me more then anything else and I'll break them down here: 

-Exercise. If my arms are ""twitchy"" I get up and do pushups. If it's my legs, I do wall squats. The key here is total muscle fatigue. If I can make the muscles shaky from exhaustion the RLS goes away for awhile. Enough for me to sleep a couple hours. Yes it blows getting up at 2am and doing pushups, but I've found it's better then tossing and turning all night. (Benefit: I have pecs of steel. No lie, I can do 70+ pushups at any moment and my chest is made of titanium from doing pushups every night for 20+ years)

-Hot Shower. Discovered this only in the last couple years. If I'm having a hard time falling asleep and RLS kicks in, a hot shower for even a few minutes helps immensely. Something about it calms the sensation long enough for me to fall asleep. It may not last the night, but if you're frustrated and can't fall asleep, I've found this helps a LOT. It's not a long term solution, but it works for me almost every time. 

-This one may be a bit more controversial. But THC is legal where I live in AZ and I discovered by accident (tried some with friends, slept better that night) that it helps. I'm not sure why or how, but I've started taking 5mg most nights and it helps me both fall asleep and stay asleep. Obviously there's issues here (build up of tolerance quickly and not legal in a lot of states) but I've found this is one of the better ""medications"" available for it. The issue is I have to take breaks from it due to tolerance and then the RLS comes back with a vengeance. 

If anyone has found solutions that work for them I would love to hear them. If you just need sympathy from a long term sufferer I'm here for you. I really wish there was more research for this and medicines that actually helped but for me that's not the case. 

Sorry for the very long post, but I didn't sleep last night and felt if this can help anyone at all it's worth it. It's nice to finally find my people!","RestlessLegs",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/RestlessLegs/comments/vjokv2/long_time_rls_sufferer_here_some_tips_ive_learned/"

Thank you for being here.","SOME TRIGGER/CONTEXT WARNINGS IF YOU WISH: naming of mental illnesses and drugs/substances by name, description of multiple drug use/abuse cycle, familial &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; domestic abuse, incest, child abuse, homelessness, eating disorder/body dysmorphia, gun violence/witnessing death

""      ""      ""

This is a long story that starts before I was born and I am now 33. Its ultimately about my recent realization that I have an unmanageable addiction and need help. But its also a short autobiography about diagnoses, attempts at getting help, genetics, brain misfirings, traumas, early benign addictions that all pointed to where I have ended up - all the tiny stones I stepped on that led me to this terrible, dark cave of addiction. I think its important to look at addiction holistically, which includes the environments, choices, and inevitabilities that led us here. Ive started by being open about my diagnoses and various traumas, then its basically an excessively long chronology of the progression of my addictive personality. Ending with my realization last week that I need some fucking help getting off of this roller coaster that is going to kill me and ruin the ones I love. 

Soooo&buckle up? Youre a champ if you read all of this personal bullshit. 

A glimpse of little me: I was a happy, gifted, fiercely intelligent child. Learning was the reason for life to me. I had too much empathy and emotion for my own good. Everyone was owed kindness and respect. I had 70 dreams and fully intended to fulfill them all. I was an optimist, and people were basically good and deserving of fifth chances. Through all the trauma, I remained this way until I was 19 years old.

With that before picture out of the way, here are my professional diagnoses &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; family history. I have  PTSD (CPTSD if it existed in the DSM yet), MDD, GAD, panic disorder, ADHD, and OSFED. Diagnosed with acute (passing) psychosis twice. Two suicide attempts with subsequent hospitalization. My mother is an addict and has ADHD, PTSD, and bipolar 1. My bio dad is an addict and has MDD, PTSD, and severe anger issues. My brother is an addict and has MDD, GAD, and BPD. One grandmother has severe GAD. I have a schizophrenic cousin, but I havent seen signs in myself yet bH. 

Major traumas: I experienced severe sexual abuse/incest and neglect for the first 6 years of my life, then verbal/emotional abuse/neglect from 11-17. I also became homeless during that latter time due to my bio dads drug/alcohol use, and experienced another incident of incest. I had a 4 year long emotionally/verbally abusive relationship through college. In 2019, a woman was shot directly in front of my house and I was the first on the scene. I held her hand, talked to her, and maintained eye contact as she died before the ambulance arrived. 

What Im doing about it: Ive been in therapy weekly since I was six, and have been doing EMDR (an effective PTSD treatment) for 3 years now. I have journaled daily my whole life, read (scientifically-backed) self help books, connect with others with similar experiences, and I have seen a psychiatrist for 10 years (I am on 7 medications and still havent found the right ones/combo). I am getting the results of a gene test for psych meds back soon, and considering physican-administered TMS/ketamine therapy. Currently just lurking in addiction subs/forums and on addiction TikTok, but today I am choosing to tell the truth and tomorrow Ill be attending my first meeting. 

So, thats the context of my baseline mental health without addiction in the picture. Lets dive into that hellhole now. 

I come from a family of addicts in generations of abject poverty. I dont mean just my parents and brother - grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, both maternal and paternal. The vast majority of the generations older than my parents are/were alcoholics primarily, excepting my grandma who preferred barbiturates. My only uncle is opportunistic and will do whatever, but prefers psychedelics. Weed for everyone, when opportunity presents itself. 

My parents were a slightly different story. Bio dads DOCs are alcohol (24 bottles a day + liquor), weed, cocaine, shrooms, meth here and there. Moms DOCs were (shes in recovery) weed, crack, cocaine. She tried meth but hated it. They both dabbled here and there with other things, but those were the big addictions and those were the things that ruined our entire familys lives. 

From Kindergarten, I was acutely aware of the difference between my sober family and my intoxicated family. Between my family and my friends families. It was uncomfortable, dysphoric, I didnt like it. I resented that their addictions caused me to be responsible for not only my own schoolwork, but also the housework, pets, dinners and breakfasts, and solely parenting my brother 4 years younger than me. I told myself early in life that I would never touch a substance like that - I would never want to look or act the way my family did. It was embarrassing and undignified and I made it my mission to distance myself from the culture of my family. 

Fast forward a bit, and I am 12. I wear baggy clothes, but they never hide my abnormally large-for-my-age breasts (D cup at that point) or obviously female hips. Its 2001, so all the popular girls and the ones in the media have flat chests and stomachs, pencil-thin arms and legs. No muffin tops or bra overflow if they tried. No back rolls. I didnt understand why I didnt look like that. I cried every time I saw myself in the mirror or got dressed. 

Around that time, I had a Xanga blog that I used as a diary to share with my friends. Millennials around my age with body image issues - I know you know where this is going lol. One fateful day, I discovered something called thinspo. I had never been so envious in my life, I didnt know it was possible to be that thin. These women were absolutely flawless to me. It didnt take long before I was active in the pro-ana/mia communities and writing down lists of tips and tricks in my journal. 

One poster said that since food is used for energy, and you feel tired when you restrict, you should drink a strong coffee each time you feel hunger. My bio dad was a heavy coffee drinker, so that one was doable. Within weeks, I was brewing myself a full pot with three times the grounds called for, dumping it into two large travel mugs, and carrying them to school. I spent all day every day sipping espresso-level black coffee. When lunch came around and I was forced to eat to keep up appearances, I would pick the foods I craved the most and eat them voraciously. Then Id guzzle water and excuse myself to the bathroom, etc etc. I saw The Devil Wears Prada and heard that one line from Emily and followed it religiously - If I feel like I may pass out, I simply eat a cube of cheese. That still pops into my head sometimes. It got to the point where if I skipped coffee, I had blinding migraines two hours later. I drank that much until 2013, after I left a Starbucks job. Managed to cut down to 3 a day, then 2. At this point I only have one if I need an afternoon pick me up. 

In hindsight - my first addiction was caffeine. My second was the control and power of an eating disorder. 

Fast forward again. In high school, the most I ever did was get drunk with friends 2 or 3 times. I decided I hated the way it made me feel, and still dont ever have more than one social drink tops. Dodged that particular bullet, however much thats worth.

Jump to the week after I graduate high school. Senior year, I had fallen in love with a very manipulative, cruel girl that I was convinced was the one. She ended up destroying my sense of self, reality, and autonomy - but thats a separate story for a separate sub. She let me move in with her at her parents house as soon as school finished. The relationship was disgusting from the start, but I didnt know better and I was afraid to be alone. She was a year younger than me, so she still had to go to high school during the week. 

This is when my third addiction began - TV and the internet. I didnt get into the only college I could afford to apply to, so I lost almost a year and a half laying in my girlfriends bed with the blinds closed, mindlessly watching garbage television for about 15 hours a day. I stopped showering. I started overeating and gained a truly astonished amount of weight in just a few months - because I was eating massive amounts of trash and not moving for days at a time. When I did leave the house, I thought about the shows I was watching the whole time. It was bad. Luckily, when my girlfriend graduated and I finally got into the school I wanted (the same one she was attending), we decided to move the 1.5 hours away together. 

In our new apartment, I quickly fell into a depression. In hindsight, it was a trauma thing - not only was I in my own peaceful space that I had control over, but also my asshole girlfriend was ruining the glow of it. Id somehow made it those 19 years without mental health symptoms, so that episode knocked me on my ass. Id never felt so low and hopeless and heavy. 

Wed have friends over most weekends and theyd all smoke some weed and then goof around and play games. I always sat with them, and for the first time it looked kind of fun and happy rather than the resentful, neglected association I had with it. I was offered a hit. I thought about my parents. About how I hated that they ignored me when they were high. And then I thought about the deep pit in my chest telling me to kill myself, versus how happy and child-like all my friends seemed. I grabbed the bowl and it was immediate, passionate love. My girlfriend was thrilled I liked it so we started buying our own. Within four months I had failed out of college. I was unemployed with no experience. I stopped reading, writing, singing, painting, studying French - all my passions previously. I spent my days either high as balls on a dirty futon watching Jackass movies on a loop, or high as balls laying in a dark room with my eyes closed and music up attempting to astrally project. All while ignoring the moldy pile of dishes in my sink and the family of mice in my closet. 

I was 19 when that happened. I did not go one day without being high - at least at night, but frequently all day - until I spent a week in Mexico THIS February. I spent my 23rd year in a shed behind my best friends house hitting GBs like we were in the 19th grade. Wed go to coinstar for money to re-up. All this time I thought it was a medicine that was helping me with all sorts of things, when its become apparent (after a week of absolute mental stability and decent sleep away from it) that was no longer the case. Its making my conditions worse and affecting my ability to eat without it. Fourth addiction - cannabis. 

Fifth addiction - benzodiazepines. In that 19-25 window, I developed severe panic attacks. Ive had anxiety my whole life - my body essentially exists in flight or freeze mode - but it had never hit me that hard. A friend gave me one of her Klonopin and that was that - I experienced existing without anxiety for the first time in my ENTIRE life. I was on top of the world, convinced it was a miracle drug. I got a prescription from my psych and took it as prescribed for a year or so - it allowed me to socialize, sit still with my thoughts, be spontaneous, avoid obsessive thought loops. I honestly was thriving for a moment there. And then&how the story goes&I hit tolerance. My doc refused to increase the dose but I was so constantly anxious I was considering suicide again. 

So, I upped the dose myself. When that first high dose kicked in, I remember thinking, Oh fuck yeah, thank you. The script was 30 PRN per month, and I ended up going weeks without from dosing higher. Then anxiety would rebound. Then I filled the script again. Etc etc for nearly 3 years. At my worst, I was at 9mg Klonopin a day for a week at a time. I did the dumbest possible thing after reading about benzo withdrawal syndrome and flushed all my meds, and told my doc Id been feeling better so we could skip filling the next one (didnt mention the abuse, of course). I dont know what noble I did in a past life or whatever, but I somehow did not have a seizure, tremors, aggression, or psychosis. I fully recognize how lucky I am and what an anomaly that was. I just told my psych my anxiety was worse again and asked for a non benzo so I wouldnt be tired, and Prozac did the trick for a bit. 

Fast forward again! My therapist one day notes to me that I can never stop fidgeting during our sessions, which she assumed was anxiety. But she also started to notice me losing my train of thought mid sentence, becoming obsessively focused on hobbies or interests or people, and regularly forgetting appointments despite being on my calendar and having reminder emails/alarms. She suggested I get tested for ADHD. Saw a psychologist for 5 hours straight two days in a row. She determined I have severe ADHD, PTSD, and OSFED, but she believed the depression and anxiety stemmed from untreated ADHD. 

I meet with my psych a week later and send her the report. She glances over it and says, Sounds good! Do you want to try Adderall or Ritalin first? Theyre basically the same. I was a bit taken aback by the choice, but arbitrarily said Adderall because I knew nothing about stimulants. She did not educate me on anything, she gave me zero warnings despite knowing my familys addiction history. She just said Sounds good! and sent the prescription in. 

She started me on 10 IR in the morning, and when I felt nothing bumped me to 20. 5 days later I emailed her saying I was crashing hard at work midday and crying a lot, which probably meant I needed to wait out my bodys adjustment period or take less. But she immediately added another 20mg IR in the afternoon, plus 15 10mg IR in case of long days. So, now Im receiving 75 20mg pills per month. I truly wasnt drug seeking - I was prepared for heightened anxiety and had no desire to take more than necessary. I assumed stimulants were just what was done for ADHD because no one ever explained any alternatives. 

When I tell you I sobbed for hours the first day I took those&my physical and mental anxiety disappeared. My body relaxed. My mood went from wanna die but dont wanna hurt wife to I am capable of getting my life in control and being a good person who does good things. My depression dissipated. For the first time since elementary school, I just felt&.neutrally awake. My thoughts slowed down, and I was able to follow one at a time without a thousand others shouting to be loudest. I felt like I had just been born, like this is how I was always meant to be. 

I started really throwing myself into being creative and proactive at work (Im a nanny, so that means expending tons of energy + fun cleanup). Cleaning/organizing the shit out of my house (my wife was starting to resent my inability to get over the executive dysfunction. Coming up with romantic surprises for my wife. Taking my dog on hour-long walks when I got home. Joining a womens choir. Reaching out to old friends to reconnect, and actually going to see them. Got really into hobbies again - painting &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; illustration, language learning, poetry, reading, guitar, hikes, friends &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; family. Even applied to my local community college to start finishing my degree. I was on top of the world, I felt better than ever, and I felt that I had finally unlocked the secret to being a functional adult.

Well. I dont have to explain what happened next, you guys know how it goes. As soon as the initial
euphoria faded, I was redosing. When that stopped working, I increased the dose. First it was a months worth in 3 weeks, then 2, then 1. I started buying from friends with bullshit sob stories, strategically different ones each time. Even then, I never had enough until the next refill.

Then my psych left unexpectedly. The practice assigned me to someone else - graduated less than a year ago from a nursing degree mill and also practices real estate. Its her first job. She decides she dislikes that I have my medical cannabis card and that Im on too many meds (7 not counting the controlled ones, on which Id been stable for YEARS). She takes one away, drops the doses on three, and changes the formulation for one. Oh, and adds trazodone even though I told her my most debilitating symptom is fatigue/lethargy. I left that appointment and immediately made one with a different practice. That was two months away, and I was about to leave for a week in Mexico.


When I was on vacation in Mexico and didnt have either Adderall or Klonopin, I was shocked at how okay I was. I think it was mostly being in an exciting beautiful place away from my problems, but a few days in and I was like I got this.. Ill quit. Two days before we headed home, I started to panic about both the plane rides without Klonopin and  returning to work without Adderall. Klonopin is prescription only in that country, and they dont sell Adderall period. I did some internet digging and ended up buying two boxes of pregabalin to replace one, and four boxes of Modafinil &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Armodafinil to replace the other. Smuggled that shit through five airports like a damn idiot. 

I took that pregabalin for a week. Decided it was shit, got rid of it. The modafinil lasted about a month. No euphoria or mood/focus improvement, but it kept me awake enough to actually function and not look like a zombie. I ordered more online just as backup for when Ive slept badly. Keep in mind, I wasnt taking a higher than suggested dose - just using it for unhealthy reasons.

I see my new psych, the one I found after dumping the real estate agent. In our first appointment I told her I wasnt doing well and she said, Lets get you back on those stimulants, huh? It was as if something took over the controls in my brain and my mouth moved without my consent - Yes, please. I function better than I have in my adult life when my ADHD is treated.

That happened on 3/18/22. As of today, 4/8/22, I have one Adderall left. Between then and now, I have spent two days up followed by 15 hours sleeping then repeat, ignored/avoided everyone who has tried to contact me, called out of work five times, have had countless panic attacks, clenched my jaw so hard I cant relax it and I chipped a tooth, followed obsessive/jealous/hypochondriac thought loops for hours and hours, dissociated on the sofa for big parts of many days, became delusional and started running/hiding from everyone in my house but my wife, thought my wife was cheating but didnt say anything about it bH, forgot to drink anything for 3 days and got a salivary gland infection, got multiple canker sores and peeling lips, and felt truly suicidal for the first time in many years. I take days off of Adderall and always cave and take an Ar/Modafinil because I dont feel I can withstand the exhaustion.

Im set to pick up an early script this Monday because its a brand that works better for me. My psych asked if I was okay with that decision and I fucking said Yeah, thanks for solving the problem! I told her Id flush the rest of the bad script. I know I need to, but I havent yet. 

I know I need to tell her whats happening, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my therapist, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my wife, mother, step father, brother, rabbi, friends. But I havent yet.

I know that feeling I got during the honeymoon will never come back. Why is my brain lying to me and saying it will be there? I know I need to stop before I literally kill myself. Why is my brain saying I have the willpower to take it as prescribed only? I know I need to fess up to my doctors. Why am I afraid of never being trusted again, or having access to medical cannabis (which I need to quit for a while anyway)? I know I need to tell my empathetic, intelligent, compassionate wife. Why I am I DEATHLY afraid of causing her - a grown woman - disappointment? 

I know all the things I need to do, rationally. Something hijacks my brain each month and tells me horrible lies and I fucking listen to it like a naive asshole. If Im being fully honest, I dont want to stop. Or Im just afraid to stop because I was useless before I took them. But again, I know they dont work anymore. I know I am about three feet away from a bad psychotic episode. I need to fucking stop and I dont know what to do. I dont have anyone to talk to. Not even my addict friends will listen because Ive ignored them for months.

If youve gotten to the end, I commend your attention span. Thank you so much for hearing my story. Ive told some people little bits and pieces, but Ive never laid it all out together like this. Writing this was really cathartic.

Edit2: The reason I'm saying ""I'll try my best"" to avoid them is because sometimes I lose control over myself. Some other part of my mind takes over. After that it's like I'm on autopilot and have no control over my actions.

So my coworker took me to the neurologist today. I described my symptoms and even gave them a self made pain chart. I also told them about how Pregabalin has absolutely no effect. No pain relief, no side effects but also no withdrawal symptoms when I forget to take them.

The doctor checked if I can still move my mouth and then told me that she thinks that the pain is to 99% psychosomatic and only 1% organic cause. And she will now get me a place in a psych ward. At least I should still get checked neurological.

The doctor already started to call around and never listed my syrongomyelia as diagnosis. She only told them about my scoliosis and told them about a suspicion that was already proven false years ago.

What makes me mad is that she didn't give me acute pain relief and that she didn't search for an alternative to Pregabalin until I'm in the clinic in order to hold me over water.

"23","2022-05-26",1653556534,"One day at a time","I'm struggling with the health anxiety for last three years. I had my ups and downs. I have been always an anxious person, but not in correlation with health. 

Everything started with pain in my chest in the middle of the night. I woke up and I had no idea what is going on. First thing I did I googled my symptoms. After some time I went to the doctor, I did whole body check. Everything was fine - healthy, young 27 years old guy. 

But from time to time I still had pains in my chests. I started feeling dizzy, breathless, I had problems with sleeping. Being alone at home drove my crazy. I was sure that staying alone equals risk and death. I had problems with travelling, my home was my save place. 

I was going with all these symptoms from doctor to another, I had multiple blood tests, EKG, echo, rtg etc. Nothing. I felt that doctors are missing something and my days are counted. 

Once, I was even refused help in the emergency clinic in the middle of night, since doctor told me I was there already three times and they won't do the EKG anymore. 

Finally, after 4 months of constant fear, one of doctors suggested I should go to psychiatrist.

During the visit I was shaking and burst in tears. I got SSRI. 

The first two weeks of adopting to SSRI were the worst period in my health anxiety. I had panic attacks everyday, the medicine increased already high levels of fears and doom. But after this period, it was only better. 

After some time I started going to therapy. Then pandemic started. Surprisingly, I was not anxious about getting covid. I got it eventually during spring of 2021 and, besides one panic attack, it was mild. 

With SSRI and therapy I learnt again to stay alone at home, exercise, travel alone and live normally. There was no need for medication and I felt I am prepared to work on my own when anxiety will come again. 

And then, my legs started cramping after covid vaccine. And I did the worst thing I could do. I googled. 

Long story short - I came back to therapy, I'm also taking pregabalin now. There are good and bad periods. Sometimes days are ok, sometimes there are some body pains or worse periods in my personal life. And that's ok. 

It might impossible to remove pains and worries. We have to live with them, but not put too much attention there. 

During this journey I learnt multiple things about myself and coping. But maybe we should not use word ""coping"", maybe ""accepting"" is better?

* DO NOT GOOGLE - if you have some symptoms, wait couple days. If there are still there, go to a doctor
* exercise - even small walk or stretching are great, do small steps
* when you feel anxious, be gentle to yourself. But don't dive too much into the thoughts. Thoughts are thoughts, not facts. Sometimes small pain in my rib I was able to exaggerate to the worst case scenario
* you are better tested than 90% of population, remember that
* Ask for help when you need
* When you feel rising wave of anxiety, lean towards it and allow to come. The more you fight the harder it gets
* Accept everyone dies at some point. The time of our death is already set. It is outside of our control. Being healthy and fit, doing checks from time to time is fine, but it may become and reassurance habit on its own
* during your time with anxiety you developed some habits and correlations. Mostly based on wrong assumptions. Here's an example. I made a correlation that pain in my chest equals heart attack. But you may have other pains there. For me, changing that is the hardest part. I have bad posture, so sometimes I feel pain in different parts of my torso. And always my first thought is the worst

The health anxiety will change you as a person. And that is fine. But try to live as you would like to, one day at a time.","HealthAnxiety",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/uy3izv/one_day_at_a_time/"

In August 2019 I lost the ability to sleep naturally after a year and a half of extreme chest pain that would trigger depending on what position I was in, callouses forming all over my right hand, my IBS went into overdrive. I had a colonoscopy on the 5th of August and a day or two later I lost the ability to sleep.

After 3 years of battling this insomnia (more accurately lack of sleep drive - I haven't yawned since February of this year) I am now on 30mg of olanzapine, 1.5mg of risperidone, 90mg mianserin, 25mg clomipramine, 2mg clonazepam and 50mg pregabalin. All prescribed off-label due to their sedating effects. On this cocktail, which I take 2 hours before bed, I sleep a broken 4-5 hours, waking up multiple times throughout the night.

My psychiatrist says he will no longer increase the medication any further because it is dangerous. Come mid August I will be sleepless. I will lose my job and go homeless. Other medications I have tried are: trazadone (no effect,) seroquel (1000mg - removed due to heart damage), valium (no effect), promethazine (no effect). It seems anti psychotics are the most effective medications. If I overdose on olanzapine by 10mg I get much better sleep. Problem is, I don't have enough medication to do this. I am dispensed 8 weeks of medication at one go. So I have an exact amount.

I haven't come across a single case in medical literature like mine. I am scared I am going to die. I haven't had natural sleep since August 2019.

High doses can be dangerous, and you should be doing your own research. These are only my recommendations based on my own experience. You will get through this!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction:**

I have been meaning for a long time now to write an in depth guide on how to stop RLS. I was desperate for this info during my taper, and it's not out there like it should be. This is the worst part of opioid withdrawal IMO, and it's something completely manageable. I am going to go over my experience, what I consider the levels of RLS, preventative measures/comfort meds, Responses and Bed Time Prep. Feel free to skip around to get to the info you need. I would heavily advise against immediately jumping to the strongest possible response I recommend. Please feel free to make recommendations for me to amend this guide with. I will try to keep this updated and potentially make an in depth taper and detox guide if this one gets enough support.

**My Experience:**

I started my taper this year around mid Feb at 4 mg with a goal of tapering down below 0.1 mg and jumping off the week of July 4th(I take this week off work every year and wanted to take advantage). In the past I had been forced to jump from around 16 mg daily, which was hell. I had RLS to the max. My RLS was so bad I couldn't even recline in a chair without it flaring up. I passed out a few times faster than it could start, and I would be woken up a few minutes later with violent and painful leg jerks.

I went to my doctor back then and asked for help, and he gave me a generic RLS drug and sent me on my way. In short, he didn't know what he was doing. I did not sleep for 2 weeks straight. The best I got were my 5 minute micro sessions, which would maybe be once a day if I was lucky. I believe I am prone to RLS, as I had it a few times as a kid normally(no detox or drug problems caused them), and I was going to be prepared this time. I am going to taper and have better responses ready.

Fast forwarding back to this year, my taper was going excellent. I was able to drop my doses weekly by around 10-20%, and I was staying comfortable. 2mg, no problem. 1.5 mg, lets go. Down to 1 mg(Not my detailed taper), and I was thinking ""this is going to be easy"". Then I got below 0.5 mg and I got my reminder of what was to come. I kept tapering, but I finally started getting RLS mildly around 0.3 mg nightly. No matter how long I stayed on my dose it wouldn't stabilize, and I was considering going back up until I knew what to do.

Luckily, this time I had more resources. I was able to taper all the way down to 0.1mg. The RLS never went away without some form of preventative actions, but I was ready for my jump this time. I had an entire arsenal at this point to stop my RLS, and my legs and I got sleep every night this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Levels of Restless Leg:**

**Minimal:** When you lay down, you feel a minor tingling sensation in your knees or elbows. You're good if you fall asleep, but it makes it hard to relax and fall asleep. It's annoying, but you're still able to sleep decently.

**Moderate:** When you lay down, you feel the same tingling sensation but strong enough to cause you to need to jerk the leg or arm you feel it in. You can still sleep through it, but it has become more difficult to fall asleep. You're not getting a good nights sleep, but you get some sleep.

**Bad:** The same feeling in moderate but worse. You are constantly having to jerk your leg, and the tingling sensation has become painful. You can't possibly ignore it. If you manage to fall asleep, you may be woken up by a jerk. If you do manage to stay asleep and wake up in a haze you will immediately be woken up completely with a violent need to jerk. You get very little if any sleep.

**Severe:** The same feeling listed above, but it's cranked up to 11. You can't even lay down. If by some act of god you do somehow fall asleep, you are quickly woken up with violent jerks. You can barely sit down or relax without the RLS flaring up. You are miserable all the time and can't sleep.

**Omega Level:** The same feeling listed above, but you can't even stop it when you get up. Sitting up won't stop it and standing might not either. You should only get here if you take the wrong comfort med mixture, but it can happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Responses and Comfort Meds:**

*I am going to go in the general order you should be trying these. We all know gabapentin, pregabalin/lyrica, and xanax can help, but these are all physically addictive and your tolerance on gabapentin/lyrica goes up extremely fast. You do not want to start using them until nothing else will help.*

**Diet and exercise:** Yes, you need to eat your vegetables and do real exercise. I know it sucks, but this will help your detox go better in general. Not only will this help your RLS, but it will also help you feel better and sleep better. Get out and jog a mile or go to the gym and do a full body workout. Squat, deadlift, bench, etc do your research on a good program for you. Also, you need to eat healthy. Taking opioids and detoxing from them drains your body of nutrients. You need to be replenishing them daily. 1 good meal with greens, white meat chicken, and fruit is better than fast food for every meal. 2 or 3 good meals is even better than that. Your goal is to wear your body out and get natural brain chemicals flowing. Your body needs to heal and this is better than any supplement your going to take will do.

**Educate yourself on what you put in your body:** Research your diet, comfort meds, supplements, etc. Many are known to make RLS worse. Things like caffeine, alcohol, Benadryl, etc make RLS worse. Reducing your caffeine intake will help. At least try to start by cutting a caffeinated drink or two out of your daily consumption. Alcohol is a no go. Even 1-2 drinks made my RLS much worse. I recommend quitting drinking while tapering and for at least a month after you jump. A lot of sleep aids can make it worse too, be sure to look up what you take. Tobacco can make it worse, though I know quitting this is it's own pile of rocks. Do your research and know what you're putting in your body.

**Pressure on your leg:** Restless leg stops when you get up because you have pressure on your legs which effects the nerves causing restless leg. Try putting pressure on your legs by having your partner lay on it. They also make boots that I have read are helpful, though I've never tried one. Knowing this can make a difference in a pinch. If you can't sleep due to RLS, get up and walk around. Let it subside for 10-15 minutes.

**Recliner/Easy Chair:** Sometimes a good recliner is all you need. There were a few nights that I got out of bed and was able to sleep in my recliner. At the very least, this is a good option to do to get out of bed and reset. You should not stay in bed long if your RLS is acting up to a point where you can't sleep. Go sit in your recliner or walk around after taking any necessary comfort meds to help you reset. 

**Magnesium Glycinate and Multivitamin:** Try supplementing magnesium glycinate at around 250-500 mg at bed time. It works as a sleep aid and anecdotally helps with RLS. Higher doses are known to make it worse. I personally never had success with Magnesium, but I know others have. If nothing else, it will help you sleep. Also, be sure to take a multivitamin daily. Iron and other vitamin deficiencies cause RLS normally, and you don't want to let this make things worse. This is something that should help you some in general too.

**Restful Legs:** These are must to have in your arsenal. They are not physically addictive and will not cause RLS when you stop taking them. You can order them on amazon if you can't find them locally. I personally took the PM version, which also works as a nice sleep aid. You can take 2-3 of these at bed time. They kick in quickly and are great quick response method to relieve RLS after you're already in bed. **Protip:** The same company makes another med called leg cramps. I took this and never had any leg cramps throughout my detox, which I normally experienced during other withdrawal experiences.

**CBD Oil(With or without THC):** Another great item for your arsenal. It helps RLS and sleep and getting off of it does not cause any withdrawals/RLS. I get drug tested at work, so I had to use hemp oil. It still made a difference though. Take it at bed time. Feel free to smoke up if that's your thing.

**Below this line, we are getting into prescription medications. Some of these have mild to severe withdrawals and you need to proceed with caution.**

**Ropinirole and other RLS specific scripts:** These did not make a big difference for me personally but they are out there. They are useful to be aware of and have ready if you resort to the items below this one, because there detox also causes RLS. Be sure to take these 2-3 hours before bed.

**Clonidine:** This acts to lower your blood pressure and is not addictive. It will not stop your RLS, but it is an effective sleep aid. This will help reduce some discomfort and help you sleep through the symptoms. You can take 0.1 - 0.3 mg(based on your doctors opinion of course) at bedtime. 

**Gabapentin:** This is the one we all talk about and that's because it's where the buck should stop. This stopped by RLS, but you've got to know how to take it. I would recommend starting at only 300 mg, which you should take 2-3 hours before bedtime. If you take more than 300 mg, stagger your doses. Take your last pill 2 - 2.5 hours before bed and take another pills 30 minutes before that. No matter how many you need, stagger them 30 minutes apart with your last one being 2 hours at most before bed. If you don't stagger your doses and take them early, your RLS won't stop at bedtime. It takes a while to kick in. Also, be prepared to taper off this if you take it for more than a week or two. 300 mg isn't bad to jump from, but any more than that for a week or two you need to taper. It can also get you high. This high will drastically reduce other withdrawal symptoms, help you be comfortable or sleep, but we will safe that for another post. Just be aware you can start a new addiction here.

**Pregabalin:** This is a much more powerful version of gabapentin, which kicks in faster and doesn't need to be staggered. It also has a worse detox. This is approximately 6 times more potent than gabapentin. It's hard to get a doctor to write, because it is a scheduled abusable substance, and I don't think any of us need it to stop RLS. Careful if you dabble with it. The danger of addiction is higher here than with gabapentin.

**Xanax and other benzos:** These do not stop RLS in my experience, they merely knock you out through the restless leg feelings. If you're at bad or severe RLS levels, do not take any, because you will be extremely drowsy and want to sleep but won't be able to. You are risking not being able to snap out of your RLS even if you get up, because of this drowsiness. Seriously, Omega Level is real and can happen to you. We all know these meds are extremely powerful and addictive so keep your dose low and only use this on occasions if you must. 0.25mg of xanax knocked me out cold for 8 hours. You probably do not need a full bar, just saying. Also, these things have a worse detox than opiates. Be extremely careful not to get physically addicted.

**Opioid your Detoxing from:** If this is not clear, opioids are a form of treatment for restless legs. If you are still tapering, consider saving some for bed time or even doing your full dose at bedtime. I tapered all the way down to 0.1 mg and I split my dose all the way up until my last day. Consider liquid dosing at really small dosages if need be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Responses I disagree with and would never advise but want to make everyone aware of:**

**Kratom:** It acts on opioid receptors, because it is an opioid, and I am not sure why some people think this is up for debate. If you decide to bridge the gap for your taper, that may or may not be a good call but this is certainly not a long term use medication to ease your restless legs. I am sure it would help but tread lightly if you insist. You can buy it at your local smoke shop and some convenience stores, at least in my area.

**Phenibut:** This is in the same class as gabapentin, however it is known to have some pretty terrible withdrawals. You can order this online completely legally, but you should do your own research on how awful it is to get off of. I am not experienced in this to recommend dosing but my understanding is it is similar to gabapentin mg for mg and it needs to be prepped and staggered.

&amp;#x200B;

**Responses:**

**I am worried about RLS and want to be proactive, what should I do?** Start by eating a better diet and getting exercise. Again, this will help you in many aspects of your detox. I know what you're thinking eating hamburgers on the couch while guzzling Mountain Dew is pretty great, and I don't want to give that up. Just know, while you're enjoying your hamburger while I suffer in the gym, that I will be sleeping like a baby tonight while you suffer. 

You should go ahead and start stocking piling comfort meds to be ready with. Order a bottle of restful legs and ask your doctor for some gabapentin and clonidine. A 1 months supply of 300 mg gabapentin capsules and 0.1 mg pills of clonidine should suite you for now.

**Mild and moderate**: Exercising daily, restful legs, and clonidine should stop this. If you experience either of these before you jump, you need to go ahead and try to get your hands on gabapentin for sure. I would recommend having enough for 900 mg daily ready, though 300 mg should be all you will need at these levels. You just want to be ready in case you get into bad or severe. I would recommend stockpiling. Ask for a bigger script with intentions of saving some for your jump. Be prepared.

**Bad/Severe:** You will likely need to be taking at least 300 mg of gabapentin 3 hours before bed. Have restful legs ready and take 2-3 pills at bedtime. They are sublingual, which I think will help trick your brain into thinking it's suboxone. Also, take your CBD oil and clonidine at bedtime if you have them. If you still have RLS at bedtime, take another 300 mg of gabapentin and a couple more restful leg pills. If you still can't sleep after an hour or so, consider a sleep aid. Do not use xanax nightly, but it is useful in a pinch that night. The next day do 2 gabapentin pills. Space them out by 30 min to an hour and take them 3 hours and 2 hours before bed.

**Severe:** If the response plan in bad/severe doesn't help, you have to keep going up on your gaba dose. Take 3-5 pills when prepping up to bed time. Your last pill should be taken 2 hours before bed and each additional 30 minutes prior to the one coming after it. Keep exercising during the day and taking restful legs at bedtime. More restful legs than the recommended 2-3 pills helped me and is a great emergency response to mild symptoms still lingering at bedtime. Even at my withdrawals peak after jumping, 3 pills at bedtime would stop my restless legs.

**Omega Level:** Just don't get here by knowing when to take what. You're going to have to take more restful legs and gabapentin/lyrica, then spend some time walking around. Try to focus to get your brain out of the half asleep state your in. If you are somehow in Omega level in a fully awake state and can't stop it, get back on your opioid or go to the hospital. A high dose of Lyrica should stop this, but I am not prepared to advise on how much of this to take. Do not exceed the daily limit of 600 mg

**If you're dealing with Bad/Severe during your taper:** You need to take some of your opioid close to bedtime and slow your taper down. Your jump is going to be worse, and it's very likely your taper is far too aggressive. Try to stabilize on your current dosage and reevaluate what you need to do next. If it doesn't get any better after 3-4 weeks, you need to be honest with your doctor and explain you need lyrica or a lot of gabapentin. Just understand, this stuff can be rough to get off of.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bed Time Prep:**

**8 hours or less before bed:** Exercise by jogging or lifting weights

**2-4 Hours before bed:** This is the time when you should be taking your gabapentin style drugs and other prescription RLS medications. Lyrica is fine to take all at once 2 hours before bed, however you need to stagger gabapentin. Dose them 30 minutes to 1 hour apart(The closer to 1 hour the better) with your last dose being 2 hours or more before bed. Follow the prescription recommendations for other RLS medications. Ropinirole should be taken 2-3 hours before bed though.

**30 minutes before:** Take your sleeping pills that you know won't give you symptoms, magnesium, restful legs, CBD Oil, clonidine and any other bed time supplements or meds you're using.

**It's bedtime and RLS still occurs:** If it's not that bad, get up for a few minutes, take a couple more restful leg pills and another dose of CBD oil and relax in your recliner. If its bad/severe and you know you prepped your gabapentin with appropriate time, go ahead and take another pill. You're going to have to wait 1-2 hours for it to kick in fully though. Try laying down every 15 minutes. If your RLS starts back, get up and reset. If you get to a point where you're having only mild symptoms, consider taking additional sleep medication like clonidine.

**It's been a few hours, and it still won't stop:** At this point, either dose a small amount of your opioid if you're still tapering off(if you've jumped already don't do this) or take a benzo if your symptoms aren't in the bad/severe range. If they are severe, examine how much gabapentin you've been taking and how effective it's been. You have to up it tomorrow and hopefully you know a good adjustment at this point. You might have to prep with an additional pill or two of gabapentin. If you can't stop RLS with a high dose of gabapentin or lyrica, you need to reexamine your taper. If you've already jumped, you need to evaluate if you need more tapering time or if you're going to boss through this. RLS can last a while after jumping. Mine stopped after 3-4 weeks, and I am working to taper off my gabapentin. I have others claim theirs hasn't stopped after months.

namely:
-Gabapentin
-Pregabalin
-Quetiapine
-Olanzipine

They also recently started cracking down on anti coag meds to be double check and WALK to the bedside with the likes of clexane, heparin, apixiban and xarelto. Like fair enough... warfarin doses can change so double checking those no problem- but fuck me, these other drug doses don't really ever change.

Its getting beyond absurd. I frequently work with assistant nurses looking after 8 pts - i dont know the USA equivalent but these people can only do basic nursing care - no meds, no obs, just bathing, rolling and toileting. Often these pts will have multiple IV infusions, S8 pain relief, NG feeds and insulin. The AIN can't help with any of these and now they want me to double check Lyrica? With who?

The fuck?

Anyone else doing this kind of shit in their hospital? I realize this is predominantly American nurse forum, but please tell me this is not the case over there.

I am a 29(F), I've had vaginismus and vulvodynia for 10 years now. I consider myself semi-cured as I can achieve PIV sometimes although most of the time it's still painful. My mental health is not always great, I also have ptsd and anxiety which makes things more complicated. I think there's a psychological component to my vaginismus/ vulvodynia which I still have not gotten over. I have had trouble with cervical smears for many years now. Many failed attempts and lots of tears. I've met my fair share of good and shitty HCPs.

A few months ago I was finally referred to have it done under general anaesthetic. The whole procedure was smooth, the hospital and the doctors were great. Don't get me wrong, it was a success and I am grateful for the care I received.  However I can't help but feel empty. Maybe I've had too much time about everything I tried over the years

I'm angry that even after years of medication, talk therapy and pelvic floor physiotherapy I am still struggling. I'm angry that it literally took years before someone was sympathetic enough to refer me for an anaesthetic. Meanwhile all those years I kept trying, did everything I was told (went to physio, pregabalin, attempted many smear appointments etc) and most of the time got the generic response ""it's not painful"" ""most women only find this uncomfortable"". I've grown very tired of people invalidating my pain. It's so de-humanizing. I feel like I'm just viewed as another body part instead of a person. The thought of having to put myself through smears for the rest of my life until menopause makes me feel hopeless.

So after many months of overthinking and a chat with my obgyn I have decided take myself off the screening list permanently. I am fully informed about the benefits and disadvantages of screening. I just don't think screening is the right choice for me. My sanity is more important to me.*Disclaimer: I am* *not* *discouraging anyone from having cervical smears, I think it's important for everyone to make their own informed choice*.

I'm incapable of making friendships - social anxiety from bullying, ADHD, fundamental self-hatred &amp; body dysmorphia doesn't help, plus these first two decades of my life I've spent very isolatedly I've got no experiences.

"40","2022-01-13",1642089813,"My parents believe it's the phone","So here's the full story. 
I had covid in November 2020. Got fever and lost taste. Recovered and was doing great. My grades were great and I was confident. Fast forward to February 2021, I had a peculiar attack where I couldn't control myself from crying and felt a strange feeling in my chest. We were having dinner so it happened in front of everyone at the dining table. I hadn't cried in years. But that attack (I don't know I'd I should call it a panic attack) just broke me. The following days and weeks, was painful. I had two episodes of where I had to be taken to the hospital because my pain killers that I take for dysmenorrhea didn't work (after covid). This was my first straw of okay, something weird has happened and it seems to have engulfed me. I had terrible nerve pain throughout the days. My dad is a doctor and he said the pain would go away and that I had some eating problems that left me deficient of nutrients, in turn giving me pain. He named it neuropathic pain. He would often give me a benzodiazepine (lexotanil) when I couldn't sleep. It never helped me.

I was fatigued most days but then there was another lockdown which relieved me of going to college. My will and energy to take baths everyday declined. I was in shambles. So my dad took me to his friend in April who is a neurologist. That friend tested my reflexes and said it was psychosomatic pain. He gave me Lexapro to counter that. I started taking it and whenever I'd take it I would shiver uncontrollably. It was probably a paradoxical reaction. My dad decided to give me Xanax for the jitters. But it also seemed to not work. He then took me to a psychiatrist in May. That psychiatrist gave me paraxyl which is an SSRI. I started taking it and it only helped me with feeling better about myself and not with the pain. I was also taking birth control pills for my dysmenorrhea. Since the pain wasn't going away, my dad took me to another neuropsychiatrist who gave me two more benzodiazepines and said I had panic disorder. My dad wasn't satisfied with the diagnosis and said I shouldn't have told the doctor that we had family history because that amount of psychological issues (anxiety and stuff) is too common. I had only told the doctor about my dad's anxiety and insomnia in his teenage and 20s as well as his consistent sleep paralysis episodes. 

Anyway, I was getting tired of the psych meds and didn't want to take them myself. My mom had booked an appointment with a renowned psychiatrist and he listened to me. Said my only issue was low pain threshold. I was like okay. One day before his appointment, I had gotten my period which was the first one after discontinuing birth control pills. It was painful and I had been given nospa and dicloren injection. I had a pelvic MRI to check for endometriosis but they found nothing. I told the psychiatrist about my dysmenorrhea and how it was difficult for me to go to school and it affected my grades. But after 5 years of pain and degradation at school, I was given pain killers. I told him about my childhood to my teenage and how it was always hard for me to focus despite having scored good on analytical tests, I couldn't study and always had to rely on the last moment to get the stimulus to actually study. He ignored that and said I had a pain threshold issue. Said I should taper off xanax and paraxyl. Gave me pregabalin and duloxetine. I didn't take them for two weeks and only tapered off xanax and paraxyl. The withdrawal was too bad. I couldn't take it with the brain zaps that were already there while I was taking them but this was just hell. So I took pregabalin to counter that and it helped. But I woke up multiple times at night feeling like I was floating. My head in a flux. 

I am now dealing with severe migraines coupled with brain zaps. I have stopped complaining. Had panic attacks twice and couldn't help but break down in front of my classmates. My parents believe I have become better but I just stopped complaining cause if I say something they say I should go out and exercise. I do go out and walk but it's really cold and exercise is a no go. Whenever they see me with a gadget, they lash out on me and then say I shouldn't shut myself off because they want the best for me and they'll taper off the meds gradually and I'll be as good as I was before though I'd still need pain killers (nospa and synflex) for dysmenorrhea. I just hate it because I don't wanna play a victim even though I'm going crazy with this migraine as I write this. I live in a religious society and myself am not. I just don't understand how they expect me to get better and taper the meds off when I have gone crazy with just some days of tapering off xanax. I feel dejected, lame and useless. My professors also gave me a hard time and my grades have declines immensely.

My parents hide the meds from me because I've had some psychotic episodes and overdosed. Anyway, I need suggestions with the migraine and would want to know how people with fibromyalgia deal with this. I take inderall for jitters and migraines but it's not working as well. Everything is going south.

It's kinda hard to sell pregabalin here cause it's OTC so it took me a while and had a little reputation in the cut there (i had helped people who where dopesick etc.) so a guy returned that favor and gave me money.

21:00 T-0:00-0:15 (450mg) after waiting for about a month i recieved my own little birthday pressent... 5 grams of F-Phenibut/4-fluorophenibut. 

i choose this dose because i have a gabba tollarance and i had nice time with regular Phenibut. also mostly reading stories from people,

that where going trough heavy withdrawls but not really i a subjective experiences so here is my experiment with this potential good chem :)

&amp;#x200B;

21:30 there was a defintive rush which is in my opinion a huge improvement of its cousin. i decided that watching the sun go down on my balcony

with a nice joint, a blanket and headphones for some good vibes while the rush came on. i have no regret taking that decision.

&amp;#x200B;

22:30 the rush part is over but there a very noticble nice buzz. my hands feel warm and there is nice pretty clean tactile sensation going on. 

typing this makes my hands feel good so i that gives me a pretty decent insight at what other body parts would feel good on this substance.

altho the effect are very evident, i feel pretty clear headed but my head also says another thing! its time for food and while i apreciate

good meals, its time for pizza with cheese and pepperoni. time to entertain myself while waiting for the pizza. its time for bar rescue or

some dumb regurgitated program. also i feel motivated to draw and socialize which are in my conciousness opposites altho also paradoxial twins?

i dunno im pretty buzzed either way. 

&amp;#x200B;

00:30 i feel like my brain has come to a state of homeostasis again, i wont say that the buzz is gone but the rush is over. this also seems

like an illusion of sobriety, which can leed to redosing. this might cause problems in people taking to much of the subsatance. i myself 

have an addictive personallity and this also might contribute to these feelings but i also consider redosing since this is all an experiment.

i do this is in a controlled enviorment and i feel like a booster dose will give us more information. i seriously do not condone unnessicary 

redosing but id say this is all for research. at 1:00 i will take another dose but this time i will just weigh en dissolve 350mg in some syrup 

and with a mars bar this goes down the hatch smoothly. i seriously discourage people thinking in this is a snortable version of Phenibut but

from the previous dose i learned altho it desolves in water this is not a snortable substance. i also feel like giving the sublinqual route 

another chance so i might split the 350mg up but thats dependant in how ""managable"" the stuff feels under the thounge.

&amp;#x200B;

01:00 350mg the deed has been done. i taste tested it and it has perculiar taste, i took a scoop of about 50mg to put under my tonque. i would say 

its managable but its not worth it. this substance can best be dissolved and drank like a shot for easiest route of administration. troughout 

the whole experience i have also been smoking weed and hasj and altho it enhances the experience a little bit, it does not seem to have strong

a synergy with cannabinoids. im curious about the naussea, psychowiki has a clear description of people getting naussea 90 min after consumtion.

i have not felt any naussea yet even tho i am ussually sensitive with those related organs. next to some rumbling in my stomach nor any bowel movement

i have been drawing and listening to music past hours. it seems like this drug boosts my creativity because there is no ""writers block"" at this

point of the evening or has there been up until this point. but comparativly to more psychedelic drugs or dissociatives, this is not the part

where this substance comes to its rights. this seems more like a social drug like most GABA-related substances.

&amp;#x200B;

2:30 this time there was no rush but i do definitly feel the buzz again. its weird but it seems like it can indeed cause some minor issue near

the stomach related area but it seems smoking weed aliviates some of the symtoms, not compleatly but it does something. again another experiment

is about to unfold. i have 3 prescriptions that i take every night, Alprazolam (xanax) Quetiapine (Seroquel) and

Pregabalin (Lyrica) and for obvious reasons i cannot skip my nightly dose. again here i am going to do something whichh i discourage anybody

to do. i have tollarance for these three substances and normally one would not end up with the same results as i expect to achieve. the movie 

i started watching is up untill now better than i have thought so the chance is likeley i spend too much time on the couch hanging getting slammed

by the concoction of downers in my system than actually going to bed at the peak effect of my daily medication. also next to my normal medication 

ive got used to take extra benzos next to my very limitedetly prescribed Alprazolam. my go to RCB has become Bromazolam. first had bars here trough

a plug but in hindsight those contained Flualprazolam. i switched to Rc benzos since i trust some vendors more then any street plug, even tho its bad

to take more drugs then prescribed, its better then not knowing what you take and eventually ending up with a seizure because you did not know how long 

the half life of a chemical was that you where taking daily.

&amp;#x200B;

3:00 -300mg Seroquel,-600mg Lyrica-2mg Alprazolam-9mg Bromazolam are taken. relativly this is dangerous to people who dont have the same tollarance

build-up, to me this seems like its gonna be a real good night. tommorow is gonna a great day after a good night rest. it might be all the GABA-acids

speaking but for me tonight was a succesfull and productive evening while having a wonderfull time. tommorow i will definitly will have to spell check

and re-read all of this and make some eddits. if i would compare F-Phenibut to normal Phenibut i would say that this is a huge improvement, the way 

this kicks in is completely opposite to Phenibut. sometimes with Phenibut it took two hours at least to start to take effect. also ofcourse how strong

this powder is compared to normal Phenibut by weight. i can say that the innitial dose of 450mg did more then 5 gram of phenibut ever did. i am curious

to what kind of changes can be made to the molecule to see what receptors can be tartgeted, for research ofcourse! i know Pregabalin and Baclofen are real

close to this molecule but there are more possibilities in theory i think. ofcrourse i want to say on toppic but here i am rambling about chemicals to my

computer at now almost 03:30 midnight.... still if i where to judge, this stuff is better if you want to have a fun evening.

POST EDDIT: i took 450mg yesterday, so 4 days later and i felt nothing. so this substance might be fun once in a while but definitly not for everyday use lol.","researchchemicals",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/vc71pd/fphenibutfphen4fluorophenibut_i_was_frustrated/"

"48","2022-12-22",1671672198,"I'm off for a year","Multiple times I wanted to get back here and write how I'm doing, ask questions etc. But let me make a post now how it's my ""first birthday off"" klonopin.

At this time last year I cold turkey quit klonopin 0.5mg a day, that was the dose I was on for more than 2 years, before I was on greater doses like 3 x 2mg daily, can't recall for how long but it all started in January of 2012 with on and short off.

In no way is that I'm doing great but at least now I can say that I'm not in full withdrawal mode, I still feel it but very little compared to when withdrawal was at it's peak, for at least 7 months I was a total wreck.

There are some things I noticed what is it like to live off klonopin. Firstly, it feels like a mental wall that was put in my head is broken, a wall that was blocking me from facing reality. Reality is pretty scary at first, even dreadful. Then I stared to experience all of the repressed feelings (some dating even from childhood), both awful and ""happy"" and everything was overwhelming when it hit me (could hit me whenever it wanted with no warning). Suddenly no matter how painful it was I like realized for the first time what it's like to be alive, instead of being a zombie that was actually unaware of being a zombie for all that time.

With getting rid of klonopin, even though I have a diagnosed anxiety for long time, it's like I for the first time actually experienced what anxiety is. Severe anxiety. Because now my depression stepped aside and let anxiety run the show. I am still depressed (diagnosed also long time ago) but I have a strong feeling that klonopin was making my depression even worse, like at least 10 times worse.

I acknowledged how literally stupid I've become on f...ing klonopin. My brain wasn't working, mental and cognitive functions were low as they could be. Logic was an unfamiliar term.

Since I have a wide range of problems, call it disorders or diagnoses, I noticed that for the first time I am able to start to love myself, or at least to go in that direction. At one point I even acknowledged that suicide is a stupid option and that it's unnecessary, which is pretty much a positive thing for someone like me who all this time lived with the belief that suicide is inevitable in my case. Not saying that all of a sudden I'm not suicidal but for me to have a thought like that is big.

...

I still struggle big time, I still am on valium, pregabalin, venlafaxine and mirtazapine. I'm working on kicking them all out, but I'm not ready at the moment as this hell of klonopin withdrawal made me pretty much scared.

Anyways, klonopin is still on my nightstand. But never did I reach for it, not for a tiny second. And wholeheartedly I would rather eat shit than take klonopin again, ever.","benzorecovery",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/zs7zd4/im_off_for_a_year/"

My question is what medicine would you concider to be the best for social anxiety? SSRI is not working so dont bother with that :D I was thinking some kind of benzo, preferable one that isn't that dangerous to get addicted too. I have also heard about pregabalin.

"50","2022-08-15",1660586284,"I can't live any longer like this. I really need help.","Im 22 and suffering from social anxiety and depression since I was 15. I tried 13 medications now and 3 therapies (2 depth psychological analytical ones, 1 cognitive behavioral one) all without any success or reduction in symptoms. I moved to a new country now and surely I think this was a great step as I can begin from new, as my past is really dark and I experienced many things I dont want to remember, (which I would if I would still be there where I was before), also good to move on from my old contacts and family to be able to start a new life and personality as my old contacts might drain my unconscious mind to my old habits and personality... 

I have a doc appointment tomorrow for trying a new medication as my current one (Mirtazapine 30mg) is another one without any success... Its sadly not a permanent doc as all the ones I got the contact to are in holidays rn. Still I hope she can give me advice for new meds. I also tried going to the gym regularly like every 2nd day and trying keto and carnivore diet but nothing helps. So in conclusion, 13 meds, 3 therapies, regular gym (while it helps a tiny bit) and diet dont help me.

What I tried from meds:

Escitalopram (Cipralex) + Promethazine; Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine; Sertraline (Zoloft); Opipramol; Paroxetine (Paxil); Duloxetine (Cymbalta); Moclobemide (Aurorix); Amitriptyline; Gabapentin; Methylfolate; Mirtazapine (Remeron); Diazepam (Valium).

I now want to give my doc a list of meds I still want to try and thought of:

Nefazodon (maybe amplified by Abilify/Aripiprazol or Lamictal/Lamotrigine)

Tranylcypromin (Parnate) (suggested by my old doc as I'm clearly treatment resistant and it could be time for stronger MAOIs as Parnate or Selegilin  Moclobemide already tried but without success - Nardil (Phenelzine) is sadly not available in my countrie or near by)

Tianeptine

Agomelatine

Or try again SSRI/SNRI/TCA but I never had luck with them so far so Im very unsure if it would make sense, for example the ones I didnt try yet like: Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), Fluvoxamine (Luvox), Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Otherwise new as needed medication (current one is diazepam but its too weak and short lasting), so maybe: Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Tianeptine, Amisulpride, Propranolol

Or maybe Im just wrongly diagnosed, maybe ADD or some other psychotic illness? As I suffer strongly from ADD symptoms and I already know when I tried Ritalin it reduced my symptoms widely, like amazingly... 

Last resort I would try Ketamine, rTMS, even microdosing mushrooms or LSD or take a trip to a foreign country and do a Ayahuasca therapy... Im really fucked. I cant live any longer like this. What should I do if 13 meds and 3 therapies didnt work, gym doesnt help enough, diet change doesnt do anything? 

So Id be happy if you could help me out somehow or give me answers to:

1. What would you do in my case? 
2. Which meds have helped your social anxiety? What effects or positive changes did you notice from them after how much time?
3. Which meds should I try next (maybe some from my list are accurate?)?

My symptoms are very bad:

\- Social anxiety seems to be one of the main sources of my depression as I: dont leave the house, dont go outside, socially isolate myself, neglect all my colleagues and ""friends"", I wouldnt call them real friends as I neglected them so often and cant be myself when being with them or anyone, even family members or yearlong friends, I cant go out my room when I dont know that a roommate is not in the corridor, so I even skip brushing my teeth sometimes and not going to the loo due to that

\- life is a daily suffering, startin from the moment i open my eyes in the morning to the moment i close them in the night when i try to sleep

\- i have dreadful negative thoughts about my past, present and future, everything seems falling over me, everything seems so bad

\- i have very low self esteem, no self trust

\- moving is hard, eating is hard, drinking is hard

\- my cognition is very bad, like memory and concentration/focus, I feel dumb af and lacking general knowledge

\- no drive, motivation, energy or joy at all, anhedonia and lethargy, lack of drive, no passions, no hobbies i follow anymore

Now I've been clean for a couple of weeks, I'm trying to stay away from other prescription pills I've been on and off for as soon as I turned 18 (benzos, pregabalin, antideps). My brain is probably permanently poisoned even though I never actually 'abused' it on a way medical proffesionals would understand it. Knowing what I know now I'd argue that putting a brain on a long term exposure to psychoactive poison is always abuse.

I feel like crap. My attention span is non-existant. I'm severely tired, it requires great effort to get out of bed. 

I HAVE to finish my thesis and graduate. I HAVE TO. I'm desperate, clueless, exhausted and self-loathing. I'm considering amphetamines now just to get this thing done.

"54","2022-11-06",1667777752,"My 3 months on Pregabalin for anxiety (successfully discontinued!)","I had a positive experience getting on, taking, and then going off Pregabalin over the course of 3 months to address anxiety. The downsides and negative elements of this medication are very well documented and I dont want to downplay that at all - it seems like my experience may be an uncommon one, but sharing this might be helpful to some, so heres my recap.

I started on Pregabalin at the beginning of August to help me with social anxiety. My wedding was mid-August and I was terrified I wouldnt be able to handle being around all those people. I cant take benzos because of past abuse, and Im Bipolar II so some other anxiety focused medications wont work with the other meds Im on. Long story short, doctor suggested 75mg of Pregabalin 2x per day.

The first few days I felt a little out of it, forgetful/hazy but not anxious. By week two I noticed it was working very well; an hour or two after my morning dose I was upbeat and feeling social and positive. I could feel it taper off late afternoon (when Id take my 2nd dose) so I knew it was something that was working and helping. I made sure to be cautious of alcohol (the 1 drink = 2 really is a thing). 

I felt totally anxiety free for my wedding and honeymoon. Amazing success, very grateful to have gone on it while knowing the dangers.

Early October I noticed the doses werent as effective anymore. Knowing that it is a tolerance building medication, I decided to begin to taper off because the major social events I needed it for had concluded. I started delaying my morning dose to see how Id feel on 75mg once a day rather than twice. I noticed increased anxiety in the mornings (to be expected!), but no significant withdrawal symptoms. Over October I eventually began taking 75mg every two days. 

Its now November and Im no longer taking pregabalin. I didnt go through hell to get off of it. More than a week has gone by since my last dose and I do feel fine. There is a high from being on it - I just stayed really mindful of not chasing that high. Now I feel like theres a medication I can take when I know Ill have a couple very socially demanding weeks. 

Again - not downplaying the very real likelihood of Pregabalin being a nightmare. Just wanted to say for me it was helpful for an 8ish week duration and I was able to come off without much trouble. I think this subreddit was extremely helpful for me in recognizing the abuse potential, and I stayed extremely vigilant for withdrawal symptoms - I just thankfully didnt experience many. In the end it served its purpose and Im grateful I took a chance with it. I stayed on a low dose, which was probably also a big part of the ease of this process; even still, pregabalin helped when I needed it.","pregabalin",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pregabalin/comments/yo6gxr/my_3_months_on_pregabalin_for_anxiety/"

SOME TRIGGER/CONTEXT WARNINGS IF YOU WISH: naming of mental illnesses and drugs/substances by name, description of multiple drug use/abuse cycle, familial &amp; domestic abuse, incest, child abuse, homelessness, eating disorder/body dysmorphia, gun violence/witnessing death

""      ""      ""

This is a long story that starts before I was born and I am now 33. Its ultimately about my recent realization that I have an unmanageable addiction and need help. But its also a short autobiography about diagnoses, attempts at getting help, genetics, brain misfirings, traumas, early benign addictions that all pointed to where I have ended up - all the tiny stones I stepped on that led me to this terrible, dark cave of addiction. I think its important to look at addiction holistically, which includes the environments, choices, and inevitabilities that led us here. Ive started by being open about my diagnoses and various traumas, then its basically an excessively long chronology of the progression of my addictive personality. Ending with my realization last week that I need some fucking help getting off of this roller coaster that is going to kill me and ruin the ones I love. 

Soooo&buckle up? Youre a champ if you read all of this personal bullshit. 

A glimpse of little me: I was a happy, gifted, fiercely intelligent child. Learning was the reason for life to me. I had too much empathy and emotion for my own good. Everyone was owed kindness and respect. I had 70 dreams and fully intended to fulfill them all. I was an optimist, and people were basically good and deserving of fifth chances. Through all the trauma, I remained this way until I was 19 years old.

With that before picture out of the way, here are my professional diagnoses &amp; family history. I have  PTSD (CPTSD if it existed in the DSM yet), MDD, GAD, panic disorder, ADHD, and OSFED. Diagnosed with acute (passing) psychosis twice. Two suicide attempts with subsequent hospitalization. My mother is an addict and has ADHD, PTSD, and bipolar 1. My bio dad is an addict and has MDD, PTSD, and severe anger issues. My brother is an addict and has MDD, GAD, and BPD. One grandmother has severe GAD. I have a schizophrenic cousin, but I havent seen signs in myself yet bH. 

Major traumas: I experienced severe sexual abuse/incest and neglect for the first 6 years of my life, then verbal/emotional abuse/neglect from 11-17. I also became homeless during that latter time due to my bio dads drug/alcohol use, and experienced another incident of incest. I had a 4 year long emotionally/verbally abusive relationship through college. In 2019, a woman was shot directly in front of my house and I was the first on the scene. I held her hand, talked to her, and maintained eye contact as she died before the ambulance arrived. 

What Im doing about it: Ive been in therapy weekly since I was six, and have been doing EMDR (an effective PTSD treatment) for 3 years now. I have journaled daily my whole life, read (scientifically-backed) self help books, connect with others with similar experiences, and I have seen a psychiatrist for 10 years (I am on 7 medications and still havent found the right ones/combo). I am getting the results of a gene test for psych meds back soon, and considering physican-administered TMS/ketamine therapy. Currently just lurking in addiction subs/forums and on addiction TikTok, but today I am choosing to tell the truth and tomorrow Ill be attending my first meeting. 

So, thats the context of my baseline mental health without addiction in the picture. Lets dive into that hellhole now. 

I come from a family of addicts in generations of abject poverty. I dont mean just my parents and brother - grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, both maternal and paternal. The vast majority of the generations older than my parents are/were alcoholics primarily, excepting my grandma who preferred barbiturates. My only uncle is opportunistic and will do whatever, but prefers psychedelics. Weed for everyone, when opportunity presents itself. 

My parents were a slightly different story. Bio dads DOCs are alcohol (24 bottles a day + liquor), weed, cocaine, shrooms, meth here and there. Moms DOCs were (shes in recovery) weed, crack, cocaine. She tried meth but hated it. They both dabbled here and there with other things, but those were the big addictions and those were the things that ruined our entire familys lives. 

From Kindergarten, I was acutely aware of the difference between my sober family and my intoxicated family. Between my family and my friends families. It was uncomfortable, dysphoric, I didnt like it. I resented that their addictions caused me to be responsible for not only my own schoolwork, but also the housework, pets, dinners and breakfasts, and solely parenting my brother 4 years younger than me. I told myself early in life that I would never touch a substance like that - I would never want to look or act the way my family did. It was embarrassing and undignified and I made it my mission to distance myself from the culture of my family. 

Fast forward a bit, and I am 12. I wear baggy clothes, but they never hide my abnormally large-for-my-age breasts (D cup at that point) or obviously female hips. Its 2001, so all the popular girls and the ones in the media have flat chests and stomachs, pencil-thin arms and legs. No muffin tops or bra overflow if they tried. No back rolls. I didnt understand why I didnt look like that. I cried every time I saw myself in the mirror or got dressed. 

Around that time, I had a Xanga blog that I used as a diary to share with my friends. Millennials around my age with body image issues - I know you know where this is going lol. One fateful day, I discovered something called thinspo. I had never been so envious in my life, I didnt know it was possible to be that thin. These women were absolutely flawless to me. It didnt take long before I was active in the pro-ana/mia communities and writing down lists of tips and tricks in my journal. 

One poster said that since food is used for energy, and you feel tired when you restrict, you should drink a strong coffee each time you feel hunger. My bio dad was a heavy coffee drinker, so that one was doable. Within weeks, I was brewing myself a full pot with three times the grounds called for, dumping it into two large travel mugs, and carrying them to school. I spent all day every day sipping espresso-level black coffee. When lunch came around and I was forced to eat to keep up appearances, I would pick the foods I craved the most and eat them voraciously. Then Id guzzle water and excuse myself to the bathroom, etc etc. I saw The Devil Wears Prada and heard that one line from Emily and followed it religiously - If I feel like I may pass out, I simply eat a cube of cheese. That still pops into my head sometimes. It got to the point where if I skipped coffee, I had blinding migraines two hours later. I drank that much until 2013, after I left a Starbucks job. Managed to cut down to 3 a day, then 2. At this point I only have one if I need an afternoon pick me up. 

In hindsight - my first addiction was caffeine. My second was the control and power of an eating disorder. 

Fast forward again. In high school, the most I ever did was get drunk with friends 2 or 3 times. I decided I hated the way it made me feel, and still dont ever have more than one social drink tops. Dodged that particular bullet, however much thats worth.

Jump to the week after I graduate high school. Senior year, I had fallen in love with a very manipulative, cruel girl that I was convinced was the one. She ended up destroying my sense of self, reality, and autonomy - but thats a separate story for a separate sub. She let me move in with her at her parents house as soon as school finished. The relationship was disgusting from the start, but I didnt know better and I was afraid to be alone. She was a year younger than me, so she still had to go to high school during the week. 

This is when my third addiction began - TV and the internet. I didnt get into the only college I could afford to apply to, so I lost almost a year and a half laying in my girlfriends bed with the blinds closed, mindlessly watching garbage television for about 15 hours a day. I stopped showering. I started overeating and gained a truly astonished amount of weight in just a few months - because I was eating massive amounts of trash and not moving for days at a time. When I did leave the house, I thought about the shows I was watching the whole time. It was bad. Luckily, when my girlfriend graduated and I finally got into the school I wanted (the same one she was attending), we decided to move the 1.5 hours away together. 

In our new apartment, I quickly fell into a depression. In hindsight, it was a trauma thing - not only was I in my own peaceful space that I had control over, but also my asshole girlfriend was ruining the glow of it. Id somehow made it those 19 years without mental health symptoms, so that episode knocked me on my ass. Id never felt so low and hopeless and heavy. 

Wed have friends over most weekends and theyd all smoke some weed and then goof around and play games. I always sat with them, and for the first time it looked kind of fun and happy rather than the resentful, neglected association I had with it. I was offered a hit. I thought about my parents. About how I hated that they ignored me when they were high. And then I thought about the deep pit in my chest telling me to kill myself, versus how happy and child-like all my friends seemed. I grabbed the bowl and it was immediate, passionate love. My girlfriend was thrilled I liked it so we started buying our own. Within four months I had failed out of college. I was unemployed with no experience. I stopped reading, writing, singing, painting, studying French - all my passions previously. I spent my days either high as balls on a dirty futon watching Jackass movies on a loop, or high as balls laying in a dark room with my eyes closed and music up attempting to astrally project. All while ignoring the moldy pile of dishes in my sink and the family of mice in my closet. 

I was 19 when that happened. I did not go one day without being high - at least at night, but frequently all day - until I spent a week in Mexico THIS February. I spent my 23rd year in a shed behind my best friends house hitting GBs like we were in the 19th grade. Wed go to coinstar for money to re-up. All this time I thought it was a medicine that was helping me with all sorts of things, when its become apparent (after a week of absolute mental stability and decent sleep away from it) that was no longer the case. Its making my conditions worse and affecting my ability to eat without it. Fourth addiction - cannabis. 

Fifth addiction - benzodiazepines. In that 19-25 window, I developed severe panic attacks. Ive had anxiety my whole life - my body essentially exists in flight or freeze mode - but it had never hit me that hard. A friend gave me one of her Klonopin and that was that - I experienced existing without anxiety for the first time in my ENTIRE life. I was on top of the world, convinced it was a miracle drug. I got a prescription from my psych and took it as prescribed for a year or so - it allowed me to socialize, sit still with my thoughts, be spontaneous, avoid obsessive thought loops. I honestly was thriving for a moment there. And then&how the story goes&I hit tolerance. My doc refused to increase the dose but I was so constantly anxious I was considering suicide again. So, I upped the dose myself. When that first high dose kicked in, I remember thinking, Oh fuck yeah, thank you. The script was 30 PRN per month, and I ended up going weeks without from dosing higher. Then anxiety would rebound. Then I filled the script again. Etc etc for nearly 3 years. At my worst, I was at 9mg Klonopin a day for a week at a time. I did the dumbest possible thing after reading about benzo withdrawal syndrome and flushed all my meds, and told my doc Id been feeling better so we could skip filling the next one (didnt mention the abuse, of course). I dont know what noble I did in a past life or whatever, but I somehow did not have a seizure, tremors, aggression, or psychosis. I fully recognize how lucky I am and what an anomaly that was. I just told my psych my anxiety was worse again and asked for a non benzo so I wouldnt be tired, and Prozac did the trick for a bit. 

Fast forward again! My therapist one day notes to me that I can never stop fidgeting during our sessions, which she assumed was anxiety. But she also started to notice me losing my train of thought mid sentence, becoming obsessively focused on hobbies or interests or people, and regularly forgetting appointments despite being on my calendar and having reminder emails/alarms. She suggested I get tested for ADHD. Saw a psychologist for 5 hours straight two days in a row. She determined I have severe ADHD, PTSD, and OSFED, but she believed the depression and anxiety stemmed from untreated ADHD. 

I meet with my psych a week later and send her the report. She glances over it and says, Sounds good! Do you want to try Adderall or Ritalin first? Theyre basically the same. I was a bit taken aback by the choice, but arbitrarily said Adderall because I knew nothing about stimulants. She started me on 10 IR in the morning, and when I felt nothing bumped me straight to 20 IR twice a day. 

When I tell you I sobbed for hours the first day I took those&my physical and mental anxiety disappeared. My body relaxed. My mood went from wanna die but dont wanna hurt wife to I am capable of getting my life in control and being a good person who does good things. My depression dissipated. My thoughts slowed down, and I was able to follow one at a time without a thousand others shouting to be loudest. I felt like I had just been born, like this is how I was always meant to be. I started really throwing myself into being creative and proactive at work (Im a nanny, so that means expending tons of energy + fun cleanup). Cleaning/organizing the shit out of my house (my wife was starting to resent my inability to get over the executive dysfunction. Taking my dog on hour-long walks when I got home. Joining a womens choir. Reaching out to old friends to reconnect, and actually going to see them. Got really into hobbies again - painting &amp; illustration, poetry, reading, guitar, hikes, friends &amp; family. Even applied to my local community college to start finishing my degree. I was on top of the world, I felt better than ever, and I felt that I had finally unlocked the secret to being a functional adult.

Well. I dont have to explain what happened next, you guys know how it goes. As soon as the initial
euphoria faded, I was redosing. When that stopped working, I increased the dose. First it was a months worth in 3 weeks, then 2, then 1. 

Then my psych left unexpectedly. The practice assigned me to someone else - graduated less than a year ago from a nursing degree mill and also practices real estate. Its her first job. She decides she dislikes that I have my medical cannabis card and that Im on too many meds (7 not counting the controlled ones, on which Id been stable for YEARS). She takes one away, drops the doses on three, and changes the formulation for one. Oh, and adds trazodone even though I told her my most debilitating symptom is fatigue/lethargy. I left that appointment and immediately made one with a different practice. That was two months away, and I was about to leave for a week in Mexico.


When I was on vacation in Mexico and didnt have either Adderall or Klonopin, I was shocked at how okay I was. I think it was mostly being in an exciting beautiful place away from my problems, but a few days in and I was like I got this.. Ill quit. Two days before we headed home, I started to panic about both the plane rides without Klonopin and  returning to work without Adderall. Klonopin is prescription only in that country, and they dont sell Adderall period. I did some internet digging and ended up buying two boxes of pregabalin to replace one, and four boxes of Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil to replace the other. Smuggled that shit through five airports like a damn idiot. 

I took that pregabalin for a week. Decided it was shit, got rid of it. The modafinil lasted about a month. No euphoria or mood/focus improvement, but it kept me awake enough to actually function and not look like a zombie. I ordered more online just as backup for when Ive slept badly. Keep in mind, I wasnt taking a higher than suggested dose - just using it for unhealthy reasons.

I see my new psych, the one I found after dumping the real estate agent. In our first appointment I told her I wasnt doing well and she said, Lets get you back on those stimulants, huh? It was as if something took over the controls in my brain and my mouth moved without my consent - Yes, please. I function better than I have in my adult life when my ADHD is treated.

That happened on 3/18/22. As of today, 4/8/22, I have one Adderall left. Between then and now, I have spent two days up followed by 15 hours sleeping then repeat, ignored/avoided everyone who has tried to contact me, called out of work five times, have had countless panic attacks, clenched my jaw so hard I cant relax it and I chipped a tooth, followed obsessive/jealous/hypochondriac thought loops for hours and hours, dissociated on the sofa for big parts of many days, became delusional and started running/hiding from everyone in my house but my wife, thought my wife was cheating but didnt say anything about it bH, forgot to drink anything for 3 days and got a salivary gland infection, got multiple canker sores and peeling lips, and felt truly suicidal for the first time in many years. I take days off of Adderall and always cave and take an Ar/Modafinil because I dont feel I can withstand the exhaustion.

Im set to pick up an early script this Monday because its a brand that works better for me. My psych asked if I was okay with that decision and I fucking said Yeah, thanks for solving the problem! I told her Id flush the rest of the bad script. I know I need to, but I havent yet. 

I know I need to tell her whats happening, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my therapist, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my wife, mother, step father, brother, rabbi, friends. But I havent yet.

I know that feeling I got during the honeymoon will never come back. Why is my brain lying to me and saying it will be there? I know I need to stop before I literally kill myself. Why is my brain saying I have the willpower to take it as prescribed only? I know I need to fess up to my doctors. Why am I afraid of never being trusted again, or having access to medical cannabis (which I need to quit for a while anyway)? I know I need to tell my empathetic, intelligent, compassionate wife. Why I am I DEATHLY afraid of causing her - a grown woman - disappointment? 

I know all the things I need to do, rationally. Something hijacks my brain each month and tells me horrible lies and I fucking listen to it like a naive asshole. If Im being fully honest, I dont want to stop. Or Im just afraid to stop because I was useless before I took them. But again, I know they dont work anymore. I know I am about three feet away from a bad psychotic episode. I need to fucking stop and I dont know what to do. I dont have anyone to talk to. Not even my addict friends will listen because Ive ignored them for months.

If youve gotten to the end, I commend your attention span. Thank you so much for hearing my story. Ive told some people little bits and pieces, but Ive never laid it all out together like this. Writing this was really cathartic. Any encouragement, empathy, or advice is most welcome &lt;3","women_in_recovery",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/women_in_recovery/comments/u07gug/long_post_i_just_admitted_to_myself_that_im_an/"
"58","2022-08-15",1660586347,"I can't live any longer like this. I really need help.","Im 22 and suffering from social anxiety and depression since I was 15. I tried 13 medications now and 3 therapies (2 depth psychological analytical ones, 1 cognitive behavioral one) all without any success or reduction in symptoms. I moved to a new country now and surely I think this was a great step as I can begin from new, as my past is really dark and I experienced many things I dont want to remember, (which I would if I would still be there where I was before), also good to move on from my old contacts and family to be able to start a new life and personality as my old contacts might drain my unconscious mind to my old habits and personality... 

I have a doc appointment tomorrow for trying a new medication as my current one (Mirtazapine 30mg) is another one without any success... Its sadly not a permanent doc as all the ones I got the contact to are in holidays rn. Still I hope she can give me advice for new meds. I also tried going to the gym regularly like every 2nd day and trying keto and carnivore diet but nothing helps. So in conclusion, 13 meds, 3 therapies, regular gym (while it helps a tiny bit) and diet dont help me.

What I tried from meds:

Escitalopram (Cipralex) + Promethazine; Venlafaxine (Effexor) + Quetiapine; Sertraline (Zoloft); Opipramol; Paroxetine (Paxil); Duloxetine (Cymbalta); Moclobemide (Aurorix); Amitriptyline; Gabapentin; Methylfolate; Mirtazapine (Remeron); Diazepam (Valium).

I now want to give my doc a list of meds I still want to try and thought of:

Nefazodon (maybe amplified by Abilify/Aripiprazol or Lamictal/Lamotrigine)

Tranylcypromin (Parnate) (suggested by my old doc as I'm clearly treatment resistant and it could be time for stronger MAOIs as Parnate or Selegilin  Moclobemide already tried but without success - Nardil (Phenelzine) is sadly not available in my countrie or near by)

Tianeptine

Agomelatine

Or try again SSRI/SNRI/TCA but I never had luck with them so far so Im very unsure if it would make sense, for example the ones I didnt try yet like: Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), Fluvoxamine (Luvox), Fluoxetine (Prozac)

Otherwise new as needed medication (current one is diazepam but its too weak and short lasting), so maybe: Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Pregabalin, Hydroxizine, Tianeptine, Amisulpride, Propranolol

Or maybe Im just wrongly diagnosed, maybe ADD or some other psychotic illness? As I suffer strongly from ADD symptoms and I already know when I tried Ritalin it reduced my symptoms widely, like amazingly... 

Last resort I would try Ketamine, rTMS, even microdosing mushrooms or LSD or take a trip to a foreign country and do a Ayahuasca therapy... Im really fucked. I cant live any longer like this. What should I do if 13 meds and 3 therapies didnt work, gym doesnt help enough, diet change doesnt do anything? 

So Id be happy if you could help me out somehow or give me answers to:

1. What would you do in my case? 
2. Which meds have helped your social anxiety? What effects or positive changes did you notice from them after how much time?
3. Which meds should I try next (maybe some from my list are accurate?)?

My symptoms are very bad:

\- Social anxiety seems to be one of the main sources of my depression as I: dont leave the house, dont go outside, socially isolate myself, neglect all my colleagues and ""friends"", I wouldnt call them real friends as I neglected them so often and cant be myself when being with them or anyone, even family members or yearlong friends, I cant go out my room when I dont know that a roommate is not in the corridor, so I even skip brushing my teeth sometimes and not going to the loo due to that

\- life is a daily suffering, startin from the moment i open my eyes in the morning to the moment i close them in the night when i try to sleep

\- i have dreadful negative thoughts about my past, present and future, everything seems falling over me, everything seems so bad

\- i have very low self esteem, no self trust

\- moving is hard, eating is hard, drinking is hard

\- my cognition is very bad, like memory and concentration/focus, I feel dumb af and lacking general knowledge

\- no drive, motivation, energy or joy at all, anhedonia and lethargy, lack of drive, no passions, no hobbies i follow anymore

Help me conclude this and understand pregabalins mechanism. It seems like pregabalin inhibits most of the neurons, but does increase activity of some neurons (disinhibition?). It does increase conditioned place preference and locomotor activity. So while it doesnt directly increase dopamine, it does affect the dopaminergic pathways one way or another. It uses different mechanism on dopamine neurons than something directly dopaminergic like stimulants or opioids, right?

does someone have any idea how pregabalin produces rewarding effect and even euphoria? Theres lack of any specific and easily understandable studies on this. Most material says it does not affect dopamine or gaba which is just false. it doesnt do it directly, but still do it. It seems to produce gabaergic effects without directly increasing gaba. 

subjective and observable behavioural effect seem to line up with dopaminergic increase SOMEHOW in some way but no one clearly knows how ?","DrugNerds",33,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/yz98sq/pregabalin_and_its_indirect_effect_on_dopamine/"
"63","2022-11-29",1669691922,"My therapist has ended our sessions indefinitely without reaching a conclusion.","TLDR; therapist stopped schema therapy/emdr sessions after so many accidental no shows. Im suffering very poor memory (leaving doors unlocked and irons on, forgetting numerous appointments), lack attention span, mild impulsiveness and a great difficulty to take care of finances and general house work / cooking.


To be clear this is my own fault. I have been struggling so much to balance appointments and often miss gp, therapy and important meetings with work. My friendships and relationships are strained and always have been. 

My best friend confessed how hard it has been for her to deal with my forgetfulness. She had to go to great lengths to be allowed to see me because of her strict mum. I very often would forget or be easily sidetracked with something else. Her mum told her Im a bad friend who clearly doesnt care enough about her. Now shes moved in shes basically taken in charge of all bills after my ex left last year. But Im not meaning to do this. Ive always struggled with this and only manage when it is very few things to juggle. Ive never missed a shift since I started my job last year but I put my entire focus into making sure I have the correct dates, often rechecking the off duty several times in one night to make sure Id wrote it correct, then checking again the next night. Ive tried diaries, calendars, reminders, alarms. Recently put up a notes board to keep track. I can constantly remind myself right up until the date and still forget. I have left the flat on numerous occasions without keys and left my iron on when I went to work my 12 hour shift yesterday.

I have some issues with impulsiveness and cant budget to save my life. I seem to have less and less money despite working more and more (buying meal deals and takeaways instead of cooking is taking up a massive chunk). Also worth mentioning I cant bring myself to cook because of the effort and only do it once a month. Everything seems so overwhelming with too many steps and I dont know where to begin. Even my brain is scrambled writing this.

My friend has complained on a number of occasions that I never properly focus on our conversations but shes learned to deal with it at this point. (I check my phone too often and speak over her a lot). I seem to have the attention span of a dog on crack. It has taken me 3/4 months to apply to one job.

I have many more examples like this but I think you get the point. I put it down to poorly managed anxiety and depression in the past but for the past several months my anxiety has been well treated with pregabalin and I find I sometimes dont even need to take it (anxiety has always been my main issue in life). I may not have the best mental health but Im far from depressed and suicidal. Im quite comfortable in my life but I cant seem to keep control over appointments and bills and remembering things. Which has been an ongoing issue for as long as I can remember.

Im deeply saddened my therapist finally drew the line but I understand why. Ive been seeing her for over 5 years and shes been so incredibly patient in the past despite my no shows. This is the first time I was properly confronted on it and I was given the choice to continue sessions without failure to comply or stop them so clients who are more in need can take them. It hurt to hear but I knew the right choice was to stop therapy as I know I wouldnt be able to focus on sessions right now. It hurt to hear my best friend confess she was very pissed off in the past but she says she understands its how I am. I definitely experienced a lot of anger from parents over poor communication and forgetting things. Leaving doors unlocked and not responding to messages for hours - days.

If I was to live alone my life would crumble, Ive needed a hand with a lot of things regarding bills and Im currently nearly Â£3k in debt which began when I was 18 (24 now).

If you made it this far thank you, it took me an age to write and Im mostly just venting my frustration but I would highly appreciate any advice on this matter.","TalkTherapy",37,"https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/z7hu06/my_therapist_has_ended_our_sessions_indefinitely/"

SOME TRIGGER/CONTEXT WARNINGS IF YOU WISH: naming of mental illnesses and drugs/substances by name, description of multiple drug use/abuse cycle, familial &amp; domestic abuse, incest, child abuse, homelessness, eating disorder/body dysmorphia, gun violence/witnessing death

""      ""      ""

This is a long story that starts before I was born and I am now 33. Its ultimately about my recent realization that I have an unmanageable addiction and need help. But its also a short autobiography about diagnoses, attempts at getting help, genetics, brain misfirings, traumas, early benign addictions that all pointed to where I have ended up - all the tiny stones I stepped on that led me to this terrible, dark cave of addiction. I think its important to look at addiction holistically, which includes the environments, choices, and inevitabilities that led us here. Ive started by being open about my diagnoses and various traumas, then its basically an excessively long chronology of the progression of my addictive personality. Ending with my realization last week that I need some fucking help getting off of this roller coaster that is going to kill me and ruin the ones I love. 

Soooo&buckle up? Youre a champ if you read all of this personal bullshit. 

A glimpse of little me: I was a happy, gifted, fiercely intelligent child. Learning was the reason for life to me. I had too much empathy and emotion for my own good. Everyone was owed kindness and respect. I had 70 dreams and fully intended to fulfill them all. I was an optimist, and people were basically good and deserving of fifth chances. Through all the trauma, I remained this way until I was 19 years old.

With that before picture out of the way, here are my professional diagnoses &amp; family history. I have  PTSD (CPTSD if it existed in the DSM yet), MDD, GAD, panic disorder, ADHD, and OSFED. Diagnosed with acute (passing) psychosis twice. Two suicide attempts with subsequent hospitalization. My mother is an addict and has ADHD, PTSD, and bipolar 1. My bio dad is an addict and has MDD, PTSD, and severe anger issues. My brother is an addict and has MDD, GAD, and BPD. One grandmother has severe GAD. I have a schizophrenic cousin, but I havent seen signs in myself yet bH. 

Major traumas: I experienced severe sexual abuse/incest and neglect for the first 6 years of my life, then verbal/emotional abuse/neglect from 11-17. I also became homeless during that latter time due to my bio dads drug/alcohol use, and experienced another incident of incest. I had a 4 year long emotionally/verbally abusive relationship through college. In 2019, a woman was shot directly in front of my house and I was the first on the scene. I held her hand, talked to her, and maintained eye contact as she died before the ambulance arrived. 

What Im doing about it: Ive been in therapy weekly since I was six, and have been doing EMDR (an effective PTSD treatment) for 3 years now. I have journaled daily my whole life, read (scientifically-backed) self help books, connect with others with similar experiences, and I have seen a psychiatrist for 10 years (I am on 7 medications and still havent found the right ones/combo). I am getting the results of a gene test for psych meds back soon, and considering physican-administered TMS/ketamine therapy. Currently just lurking in addiction subs/forums and on addiction TikTok, but today I am choosing to tell the truth and tomorrow Ill be attending my first meeting. 

So, thats the context of my baseline mental health without addiction in the picture. Lets dive into that hellhole now. 

I come from a family of addicts in generations of abject poverty. I dont mean just my parents and brother - grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, both maternal and paternal. The vast majority of the generations older than my parents are/were alcoholics primarily, excepting my grandma who preferred barbiturates. My only uncle is opportunistic and will do whatever, but prefers psychedelics. Weed for everyone, when opportunity presents itself. 

My parents were a slightly different story. Bio dads DOCs are alcohol (24 bottles a day + liquor), weed, cocaine, shrooms, meth here and there. Moms DOCs were (shes in recovery) weed, crack, cocaine. She tried meth but hated it. They both dabbled here and there with other things, but those were the big addictions and those were the things that ruined our entire familys lives. 

From Kindergarten, I was acutely aware of the difference between my sober family and my intoxicated family. Between my family and my friends families. It was uncomfortable, dysphoric, I didnt like it. I resented that their addictions caused me to be responsible for not only my own schoolwork, but also the housework, pets, dinners and breakfasts, and solely parenting my brother 4 years younger than me. I told myself early in life that I would never touch a substance like that - I would never want to look or act the way my family did. It was embarrassing and undignified and I made it my mission to distance myself from the culture of my family. 

Fast forward a bit, and I am 12. I wear baggy clothes, but they never hide my abnormally large-for-my-age breasts (D cup at that point) or obviously female hips. Its 2001, so all the popular girls and the ones in the media have flat chests and stomachs, pencil-thin arms and legs. No muffin tops or bra overflow if they tried. No back rolls. I didnt understand why I didnt look like that. I cried every time I saw myself in the mirror or got dressed. 

Around that time, I had a Xanga blog that I used as a diary to share with my friends. Millennials around my age with body image issues - I know you know where this is going lol. One fateful day, I discovered something called thinspo. I had never been so envious in my life, I didnt know it was possible to be that thin. These women were absolutely flawless to me. It didnt take long before I was active in the pro-ana/mia communities and writing down lists of tips and tricks in my journal. 

One poster said that since food is used for energy, and you feel tired when you restrict, you should drink a strong coffee each time you feel hunger. My bio dad was a heavy coffee drinker, so that one was doable. Within weeks, I was brewing myself a full pot with three times the grounds called for, dumping it into two large travel mugs, and carrying them to school. I spent all day every day sipping espresso-level black coffee. When lunch came around and I was forced to eat to keep up appearances, I would pick the foods I craved the most and eat them voraciously. Then Id guzzle water and excuse myself to the bathroom, etc etc. I saw 13 Going on 30 and heard that one line and followed it religiously - If I feel like I may pass out, I simply eat a cube of cheese. That still pops into my head sometimes. It got to the point where if I skipped coffee, I had blinding migraines two hours later. I drank that much until 2013, after I left a Starbucks job. Managed to cut down to 3 a day, then 2. At this point I only have one if I need an afternoon pick me up. 

In hindsight - my first addiction was caffeine. My second was the control and power of an eating disorder. 

Fast forward again. In high school, the most I ever did was get drunk with friends 2 or 3 times. I decided I hated the way it made me feel, and still dont ever have more than one social drink tops. Dodged that particular bullet, however much thats worth.

Jump to the week after I graduate high school. Senior year, I had fallen in love with a very manipulative, cruel girl that I was convinced was the one. She ended up destroying my sense of self, reality, and autonomy - but thats a separate story for a separate sub. She let me move in with her at her parents house as soon as school finished. The relationship was disgusting from the start, but I didnt know better and I was afraid to be alone. She was a year younger than me, so she still had to go to high school during the week. 

This is when my third addiction began - TV and the internet. I didnt get into the only college I could afford to apply to, so I lost almost a year and a half laying in my girlfriends bed with the blinds closed, mindlessly watching garbage television for about 15 hours a day. I stopped showering. I started overeating and gained a truly astonished amount of weight in just a few months - because I was eating massive amounts of trash and not moving for days at a time. When I did leave the house, I thought about the shows I was watching the whole time. It was bad. Luckily, when my girlfriend graduated and I finally got into the school I wanted (the same one she was attending), we decided to move the 1.5 hours away together. 

In our new apartment, I quickly fell into a depression. In hindsight, it was a trauma thing - not only was I in my own peaceful space that I had control over, but also my asshole girlfriend was ruining the glow of it. Id somehow made it those 19 years without mental health symptoms, so that episode knocked me on my ass. Id never felt so low and hopeless and heavy. 

Wed have friends over most weekends and theyd all smoke some weed and then goof around and play games. I always sat with them, and for the first time it looked kind of fun and happy rather than the resentful, neglected association I had with it. I was offered a hit. I thought about my parents. About how I hated that they ignored me when they were high. And then I thought about the deep pit in my chest telling me to kill myself, versus how happy and child-like all my friends seemed. I grabbed the bowl and it was immediate, passionate love. My girlfriend was thrilled I liked it so we started buying our own. Within four months I had failed out of college. I was unemployed with no experience. I stopped reading, writing, singing, painting, studying French - all my passions previously. I spent my days either high as balls on a dirty futon watching Jackass movies on a loop, or high as balls laying in a dark room with my eyes closed and music up attempting to astrally project. All while ignoring the moldy pile of dishes in my sink and the family of mice in my closet. 

I was 19 when that happened. I did not go one day without being high - at least at night, but frequently all day - until I spent a week in Mexico THIS February. I spent my 23rd year in a shed behind my best friends house hitting GBs like we were in the 19th grade. Wed go to coinstar for money to re-up. All this time I thought it was a medicine that was helping me with all sorts of things, when its become apparent (after a week of absolute mental stability and decent sleep away from it) that was no longer the case. Its making my conditions worse and affecting my ability to eat without it. Fourth addiction - cannabis. 

Fifth addiction - benzodiazepines. In that 19-25 window, I developed severe panic attacks. Ive had anxiety my whole life - my body essentially exists in flight or freeze mode - but it had never hit me that hard. A friend gave me one of her Klonopin and that was that - I experienced existing without anxiety for the first time in my ENTIRE life. I was on top of the world, convinced it was a miracle drug. I got a prescription from my psych and took it as prescribed for a year or so - it allowed me to socialize, sit still with my thoughts, be spontaneous, avoid obsessive thought loops. I honestly was thriving for a moment there. And then&how the story goes&I hit tolerance. My doc refused to increase the dose but I was so constantly anxious I was considering suicide again. So, I upped the dose myself. When that first high dose kicked in, I remember thinking, Oh fuck yeah, thank you. The script was 30 PRN per month, and I ended up going weeks without from dosing higher. Then anxiety would rebound. Then I filled the script again. Etc etc for nearly 3 years. At my worst, I was at 9mg Klonopin a day for a week at a time. I did the dumbest possible thing after reading about benzo withdrawal syndrome and flushed all my meds, and told my doc Id been feeling better so we could skip filling the next one (didnt mention the abuse, of course). I dont know what noble I did in a past life or whatever, but I somehow did not have a seizure, tremors, aggression, or psychosis. I fully recognize how lucky I am and what an anomaly that was. I just told my psych my anxiety was worse again and asked for a non benzo so I wouldnt be tired, and Prozac did the trick for a bit. 

Fast forward again! My therapist one day notes to me that I can never stop fidgeting during our sessions, which she assumed was anxiety. But she also started to notice me losing my train of thought mid sentence, becoming obsessively focused on hobbies or interests or people, and regularly forgetting appointments despite being on my calendar and having reminder emails/alarms. She suggested I get tested for ADHD. Saw a psychologist for 5 hours straight two days in a row. She determined I have severe ADHD, PTSD, and OSFED, but she believed the depression and anxiety stemmed from untreated ADHD. 

I meet with my psych a week later and send her the report. She glances over it and says, Sounds good! Do you want to try Adderall or Ritalin first? Theyre basically the same. I was a bit taken aback by the choice, but arbitrarily said Adderall because I knew nothing about stimulants. She started me on 10 IR in the morning, and when I felt nothing bumped me straight to 20 IR twice a day. 

When I tell you I sobbed for hours the first day I took those&my physical and mental anxiety disappeared. My body relaxed. My mood went from wanna die but dont wanna hurt wife to I am capable of getting my life in control and being a good person who does good things. My depression dissipated. My thoughts slowed down, and I was able to follow one at a time without a thousand others shouting to be loudest. I felt like I had just been born, like this is how I was always meant to be. I started really throwing myself into being creative and proactive at work (Im a nanny, so that means expending tons of energy + fun cleanup). Cleaning/organizing the shit out of my house (my wife was starting to resent my inability to get over the executive dysfunction. Taking my dog on hour-long walks when I got home. Joining a womens choir. Reaching out to old friends to reconnect, and actually going to see them. Got really into hobbies again - painting &amp; illustration, poetry, reading, guitar, hikes, friends &amp; family. Even applied to my local community college to start finishing my degree. I was on top of the world, I felt better than ever, and I felt that I had finally unlocked the secret to being a functional adult.

Well. I dont have to explain what happened next, you guys know how it goes. As soon as the initial
euphoria faded, I was redosing. When that stopped working, I increased the dose. First it was a months worth in 3 weeks, then 2, then 1. 

Then my psych left unexpectedly. The practice assigned me to someone else - graduated less than a year ago from a nursing degree mill and also practices real estate. Its her first job. She decides she dislikes that I have my medical cannabis card and that Im on too many meds (7 not counting the controlled ones, on which Id been stable for YEARS). She takes one away, drops the doses on three, and changes the formulation for one. Oh, and adds trazodone even though I told her my most debilitating symptom is fatigue/lethargy. I left that appointment and immediately made one with a different practice. That was two months away, and I was about to leave for a week in Mexico.


When I was on vacation in Mexico and didnt have either Adderall or Klonopin, I was shocked at how okay I was. I think it was mostly being in an exciting beautiful place away from my problems, but a few days in and I was like I got this.. Ill quit. Two days before we headed home, I started to panic about both the plane rides without Klonopin and  returning to work without Adderall. Klonopin is prescription only in that country, and they dont sell Adderall period. I did some internet digging and ended up buying two boxes of pregabalin to replace one, and four boxes of Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil to replace the other. Smuggled that shit through five airports like a damn idiot. 

I took that pregabalin for a week. Decided it was shit, got rid of it. The modafinil lasted about a month. No euphoria or mood/focus improvement, but it kept me awake enough to actually function and not look like a zombie. I ordered more online just as backup for when Ive slept badly. Keep in mind, I wasnt taking a higher than suggested dose - just using it for unhealthy reasons.

I see my new psych, the one I found after dumping the real estate agent. In our first appointment I told her I wasnt doing well and she said, Lets get you back on those stimulants, huh? It was as if something took over the controls in my brain and my mouth moved without my consent - Yes, please. I function better than I have in my adult life when my ADHD is treated.

That happened on 3/18/22. As of today, 4/8/22, I have one Adderall left. Between then and now, I have spent two days up followed by 15 hours sleeping then repeat, ignored/avoided everyone who has tried to contact me, called out of work five times, have had countless panic attacks, clenched my jaw so hard I cant relax it and I chipped a tooth, followed obsessive/jealous/hypochondriac thought loops for hours and hours, dissociated on the sofa for big parts of many days, became delusional and started running/hiding from everyone in my house but my wife, thought my wife was cheating but didnt say anything about it bH, forgot to drink anything for 3 days and got a salivary gland infection, got multiple canker sores and peeling lips, and felt truly suicidal for the first time in many years. I take days off of Adderall and always cave and take an Ar/Modafinil because I dont feel I can withstand the exhaustion.

Im set to pick up an early script this Monday because its a brand that works better for me. My psych asked if I was okay with that decision and I fucking said Yeah, thanks for solving the problem! I told her Id flush the rest of the bad script. I know I need to, but I havent yet. 

I know I need to tell her whats happening, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my therapist, but I havent yet.
I know I need to tell my wife, mother, step father, brother, rabbi, friends. But I havent yet.

I know that feeling I got during the honeymoon will never come back. Why is my brain lying to me and saying it will be there? I know I need to stop before I literally kill myself. Why is my brain saying I have the willpower to take it as prescribed only? I know I need to fess up to my doctors. Why am I afraid of never being trusted again, or having access to medical cannabis (which I need to quit for a while anyway)? I know I need to tell my empathetic, intelligent, compassionate wife. Why I am I DEATHLY afraid of causing her - a grown woman - disappointment? 

I know all the things I need to do, rationally. Something hijacks my brain each month and tells me horrible lies and I fucking listen to it like a naive asshole. If Im being fully honest, I dont want to stop. Or Im just afraid to stop because I was useless before I took them. But again, I know they dont work anymore. I know I am about three feet away from a bad psychotic episode. I need to fucking stop and I dont know what to do. I dont have anyone to talk to. Not even my addict friends will listen because Ive ignored them for months.

If youve gotten to the end, I commend your attention span. Thank you so much for hearing my story. Ive told some people little bits and pieces, but Ive never laid it all out together like this. Writing this was really cathartic.

"71","2022-08-22",1661153751,"Misdiagnosed and overmedicated for 6 years","Hey /r/OCD/. I just want to share my experience, and vent a little bit.

It all started with paranoid OCD-thoughts that was so powerful, that it fucked my life up. Anxiety, rituals, unwanted thoughts. It made me deeply depressed, and I did the unthinkable. Luckily I failed. The psychiatrist firstly diagnosed me with OCD (correctly) but I did not respond to the ultimate OCD-medication. (Clomipramine). I got worse over the next year, and I got desperate. The thoughts got more and more paranoid. In the end I got admitted, and quickly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, since I clearly didnt respond to OCD-treatment. Thats when hell really began.

Firstly risperidon, then abilify, then quetiapine, then truxal, then olanzapine. I got fat, lost my social life, my ability to concentrate. I started shaking uncontrollably, and had difficulty navigating down stairs.

In the end, they gave me the unthinkable. The ultimate drug. Clozapine. It shut down my brain completely. And I was able to exist. The doctors considered it a success, and that should have been the end of it. 

But no, the anxiety came back, and I got benzodiazepines and pregabalin. The rituals persisted through it all. And I developed severe coordination issues and abscence epilepsy. In the end I was on 350mg clozapine, 900mg quetiapine, 15mg abilify, 15mg oxazepam, and 800mg valproate, daily. 

It had now been 5 years. Then I got desperate, and a new psychiatrist prescribed a relatively small dose (100mg) of sertraline. And within 2 months, 90% of my anxiety was gone. I went against the doctors recommendation, and I reduced and stopped clozapine and quetiapine within 4 months. Little to no paranoia.

Then summer came, and I started shaking. I couldnt walk downhill, double vision, headache, hypomania. It all. Couldnt sleep. Apparently it was caused by the rapid discontinuation of antipsychotics. And the doctor (not a psychiatrist) prescribed Mirtazapine 15mg so I could sleep. 

4 weeks went by. And suddenly I was free. The paranoia and anxiety was gone. I tried to quit abilify, no paranoia, no anxiety, no rituals. Freedom. Freedom from the OCD, freedom from the side effects. My coordination is back, I can think, my hunger is manageable.

I am now completely anxiety free, and Im having an identity crisis. I was open about my schizophrenia, but now I know it was an OCD with paranoid anxiety. Im ready to move, and start a new life. Hope this story can help someone.

I took 900mg of pregabalin on a whim at university; just to see what it was like (Disclaimer: taking 900mg of pregabalin is above the maximum daily dose and is NOT recommended due to risk of potential harm).  I instantly felt motivated, for the first time I could remember I actually wanted to get out of bed, talk to people, go out with friends. It felt amazing.

So I had recurrent depression and what I thought was social anxiety my whole adult life. When I discovered Phenibut a few years back my whole world changed. It was a wonder drug, the one pill to rule them all.  I could see people for people instead of potential threats in social settings. I could small talk and enjoy myself like a normal person would with people. It also helps a lot with my depression, things just don't seem to be bleak all the time, I head a realistic, even optimistic outlook.

However, what comes to normal, must go back to shit.

The down 3-6 days after 1-2 days of  ""life is good"" aren't pretty. Hence I was very disciplined about usage frequency, only once every 2-3 weeks. That was enough to remind myself that there is a state where life is worth living for, and not a pit of tar that you try not to drown in with sheer willpower. I read the horror stories about frequent or constant usage and I avoided it.

This year life gave me a kick in the stomach and depression phase got really low. I am just recovering from that, and maybe I""ll survive this time again. However, I want to find a permanent solution, or I wont make it to the end.

Since GABBA, unlike Serotonin based stuff and other things I tried(the list is long), helps me, I fought for getting pregabalin prescribed and got it. I take it for several months now(300mg) and it's fine. However, it makes me dumb. Really fralling stupid. My memory, both short and long, especially is absolute trash. It seems to be a focus issue in general, as in focus on remembering why I am in the room I just entered.

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short: I want to try Gabapentin instead of Pregabalin. I have a job where I need my brain, and the, lets call it brainfog, makes me not suitable for the kind of work I do. I ask those who have this miracle experiences on phenibut because I assume our chemistry is similarly wired. I know you are out there, this is how I got to know about phenibut in the first place. This is the first time I reach out like this.

edit: My fralling brain, I swear to god ...So here is the question: What experience did you make with Gabapentin, compared to phenibut compared to pregabalin ?

I also wanted to add that I react to GABBA supplements themselves well, to which a lot of people have absolutely no reaction whatsoever.

"83","2022-07-02",1656793556,"Ankylosing spondylitis","Hey :) I thought I had fibromyalgia for 7 years. 

One obvious difference to the normal fibromyalgia patient is that I am 25 and male. 

I had/have a lot of back pain, really bad in the upper back and jaw joints. My hip, shoulders and lower back are also painful if I dont move enough. Mainly I was really debilitated by fatigue and brain fog though and not the pain itself. Exercise is the only thing that helped and I go running 4x a week. It also improves my sleep. 

Never had tender points, but the widespread pain was enough to diagnose fibromyalgia. This was diagnosed 6 years ago. Tests to exclude other diseases: rheumatoid factors were negative and an MRI of my upper back pain was fine.

Fast forward to a month ago. I had Covid with really bad chest pain. Got a CT scan. Heart is fine and those symptoms are slowly getting better. 

However, both of my sacroiliac joints have extensive inflammatory changes. Ankylosing spondylitis was diagnosed quite quickly. 

I am a bit shocked, angry and confused. I cycled through Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline, Duloxetine, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Mirtazapine and Bupropion to manage fatigue and pain for 7 years.

Now I am on 1200mg of Naproxen and doing better fatigue and pain wise than ever before. Never thought of taking such a high dose of NSAIDs so didnt realize they can help.

Maybe somebody with a wrong diagnosis reads this and thinks about calling their doctor again :)","Fibromyalgia",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/vq0dny/ankylosing_spondylitis/"
"84","2022-10-22",1666405559,"Saying I'm traumatized from akathisia is an understatement. Here's (part of) my akathisia story","I have had akathisia since summer of 2020, and my symptoms only became manageable in the last eight months or so- before that I felt like I was going to die from this for over a year and a half straight. You guys don't even need an explanation of the torture that this is, because if you're in this sub, you probably know. I just wanted to see if any of you can relate to how traumatized, depressed, and changed (for the worse) I am because of this condition. The part that kills me the most is that I didn't know akathisia existed until one year ago when I FOUND IT THROUGH MY OWN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DESPERATION TO FIGURE THIS OUT. This was when I'd already been suffering from it for over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm 25 years old and have been put on over 20 psychiatric medications (in every drug class) with rapid switches, tapers, cold turkeys, and reinstatements, all of which were recommended by my fucking psychiatrists who never told me akathisia existed. Instead they told me I had anxiety and prescribed even more meds, therefore worsening my akathisia. I was put on antipsychotics for treatment resistant depression. DEPRESSION. I have no symptoms of psychosis whatsoever, so it makes me furious that I was put on all these medications to treat completely different mental illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis, etc.) that I never even had. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe vraylar is what started my akathisia, and then every medication they put me on after that made it worse and prolonged the symptoms. But then again, it could be any of the other 20+ of them, or some weird part of my brain triggered from the combination of them all. I'm angry, I'm hurt, I've had prime years taken away from me, and I've had to stay so strong through all of this. Sometimes I feel so hurt by the mere fact that I'm essentially living a double life, since nobody knows or cares about akathisia, and it's not worth explaining because the torture can't be put into words. I've seen lots of others refer to it as the worst thing on earth a human could experience, and the first time I found people online talking about the absolute hell akathisia is, I cried because I finally felt valid. This whole time I've been telling myself I'm a piece of shit because I can't just be healthy and normal and calm down, and I've been made to feel crazy from my doctors, so it felt really good to hear people describe it accurately because it finally proved to me that I'm not crazy. I was, and am, just tired of suffering. I can't even imagine what the very doctors prescribing these meds would do if they were subjected to this, but that's a conversation for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, I suffered all of this in silence. Nobody knew or understood what I was going through, because not even my doctors warned me of this, and I've been debilitated by it for almost 2 and a half years now. I have to watch every little tiny thing I do and ingest because I live in fear that I'll trigger it again. I wake up every morning and have to get out of bed immediately, no matter how exhausted I am from the bullshit sleep I've gotten all this time, because I cannot stay still. I've worked full time the whole time with akathisia, I couldn't afford not to. Looking back, I realize that I've used my negative self talk, anxiety, and fear of losing everything to maintain a ""normal"" life (this is how people see me from the outside), and keep trudging forward, instead of admitting defeat and giving up like I've so badly wanted for so long. Akathisia has shown me that we, humans, really will do anything it takes to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

I started abusing alcohol to get my body and brain to calm down, and am now an alcoholic (14 days sober today, I'm working on it). One of the things that saddens me the most is that one of my prescribers in this awful journey, a nurse practitioner, kept shaming me for drinking alcohol to calm down and told me I wouldn't be able to get better if I didn't stop drinking, meanwhile giving me the medications that caused me to drink to get rid of the akathisia feeling. I have since developed a horrible view of myself and am constantly shameful of my history of drinking the past couple of years, despite alcohol probably being the only reason I'm still alive right now. Yes, akathisia is so bad that alcohol, liquid poison, was the only thing that saved me from it. No meds worked to help except benzos and I couldn't take them long term for obvious reasons, so I just had to wait. I tried propranolol, clonidine, xanax, fake xanax that came from the street, cogentin, gabapentin, pregabalin, pramipexole, and every supplement ever even shown to be slightly calming for the nervous system. No relief. Before akathisia, I never knew that the ability to wait patiently should be cherished. I never knew sitting or lying still was something I should consider a gift.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a shell of my old self, going through the motions to stay alive. I don't even remember the old me honestly- although I have always suffered from severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and pmdd, I at least used to have moments of pure joy, and drive to do some things. For instance, hobbies. I remember when weightlifting, painting, crafting, making films, etc. made me feel at least halfway fulfilled. Now I only do these things because I force myself to (probably to maintain the ""I'm doing great"" facade to not worry anybody), and they don't make me happy. When I look at old pictures of myself before I developed akathisia, it makes me sob sometimes, because there was still moments where I had a twinkle in my eye. I've never felt so empty. Akathisia is isolation, torture, and suffocation all at once. It's also given me agoraphobic tendencies (in the worst times of my akathisia, I had to drink a beer or two/a couple shots before going in to grab a couple things from the store because my body was on fire from the akathisia and the anxiety was like nothing else I've experienced in my life).

&amp;#x200B;

Can I sue my psychiatrists? Can I get justice for this in any way? Can anyone understand how I'm feeling? I fear that the mental repercussions I've suffered because of akathisia are too great to ever fully overcome/recover from. It has been so damaging. I liken my emotional state now to the aftermath of an earthquake, where everything has been shaken, destroyed, and torn up, and the mess is so devastating that nobody knows where to even start picking up the pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't enjoy anything anymore, really. As absolutely grateful as I am for my symptoms lessening in severity after almost two years of skin crawling torture, I can't shake what it's done to my spirit. And I'm in therapy (have been since I was 18), trying to work through it, but I also try not to fixate and ruminate on it, and I guess I can't seem to find that balance. I am still incredibly cheerful, polite, and kind to those around me, just like the old me was, but I'm always awaiting the moment I can find an empty room and shut the door behind me. At least that way, I don't have to pretend I haven't been fully consumed by darkness. All I really know is wishing time away. And then feeling sorry for myself. And then saying to myself ""fuck you, stop sulking, stop pitying yourself, get yourself together and do everything in your power to heal yourself so you can be happy, because this sad shit is getting old."" So then, I devote all my spare time to be alone and conduct obsessive health research to recover from this, monitor and record everything I do, eat, drink, every workout I do, do some more research, talk some more shit to myself, inevitably get exhausted by trying to keep up when I'm this broken, beat myself up for not being ""perfect,"" then... the cycle repeats. 

&amp;#x200B;

What scares me the most is that I'll never get my old self back. This has been the most brutal, unfair, maddening, and heartbreaking thing I've ever gone through and I'll never be able to forget it. Even if I'm not thinking about it, I'm still thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this, thank you. So much. If you didn't read it, I thank you still, for being here and holding on with white knuckles despite the hell placed upon you undeservingly. This was also just for me to get this off my chest, because I don't know where else to do it to where I feel like it'll mean anything. So thank you for allowing me the space to do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this was all over the place, and for that, I apologize. I guess I can't really organize the rage and despair I hold in my heart and my head on this matter.

**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors | SSRIs**

**citalopram, celexa, escitalopram, lexapro, fluoxetine, prozac, sarafem, symbyax, fluvoxamine, luvox, luvox CR, paroxetine, paxil, paxil CR, pexeva, sertraline, zoloft, vilazodone, viibryd**

Drug class

This is a very common drug class; prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, bipolar disorders, migraines, panic attacks, eating disorders, PTSD, OCD, and even chronic pain. Over 10% of the US takes an SSRI.

What Do SSRIs Do?

What does every medication within this class have in common? They all increase the level of Serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. When you take a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, youre blocking the neurons from reabsorbing Serotonin, meaning there is more Serotonin available.

So what does Serotonin do? Well, A LOT. Serotonin influences our mood and emotional state, our digestion, appetite, our sleep cycle. It is found in your brain, in your intestines and even in your blood. One could argue that it impacts everything.

Did You Know?

Serotonin is even in animals, plants and fungus. While we can measure the levels in our blood we cannot measure the levels within our brain. Meaning were all in the dark as to how much is within our brain and whether or not its even correlated to the amount in our blood.

How SSRIs Impact Memory

Age and gender do not seem to influence the data that SSRIs are correlated with memory effects. Something that is important to mention, is that while research has shown that SSRIs are *correlated* with memory loss, that doesnt exactly mean that they CAUSE it. Correlation and cause are two different things. Many people that take SSRIs also take benzodiazepines, drink, smoke, have genetic predisposition to memory loss, etc. Depression and anxiety themselves can even cause memory problems.

Summary

So, after reading through many articles, there overall wasnt enough credible information to emphatically say that an SSRI causes memory loss. In fact, I came across more research that suggested SSRIs improve cognitive performance and memory. Some data also specifically supported that SSRIs can improve memory for patients experiencing psychosis and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tricyclic AntidepressantÂ  | TCAs**

**anafranil, clomipramine, asendin, amoxapine, elavil, amitriptyline, norpramin, desipramine, pamelor, nortriptyline, sinequan, doxepin, surmontil, trimipramine, tofranil, imipramine, vivactil, protiptyline**

Drug Class

The word tricyclic refers to the three molecular ring shapes associated with this drug class. These existed before SSRIs, but they seem to cause more side effects. This has led to SSRIs being more commonly prescribed nowadays. TCAs are still often administered for things like anxiety, depression, migraines, panic disorder, eating disorders, mood disorders, insomnia, hormone disorders, bedwetting, and even nerve pain.

What do Tricyclic Antidepressants Do?

What do all TCAs have in common? Similar to an SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants impact neurotransmitters. But, in addition to serotonin, they also block the reabsorption of norepinephrine. They ALSO block acetylcholine receptors. These key differences create a cascade of effects in the body that do impact memory. These key differences are also the culprit for the common side effects in this drug class like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.

Did You Know?

In 1945, the Sulphur bridge of the phenothiazine ring of promethazine was altered to synthesize G22355 ( a weak antihistamine and mild anticholinergic with sedative properties). The new 'invention' was tested as an antipsychotic. It was ineffective for schizophrenia, but did have antidepressant properties. Thus, the first clinically useful tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) was discovered.

How TCAs Impact Memory

There are multiple reasons why a TCA impacts our memory. **The first reason** is that we retain memory best when norepinephrine is released at an optimal rate. These drugs block the reabsorption of norepinephrine; which is known to be a moderator of memory. With too much of it, we are anxious and stressed, too little of it and we are drowsy and not as coherent. Either way, the drug has an impact on norepinephrine which directly influences how we store memory.

**The second reason** why this drug class impacts memory is because it competes with our natural antagonists on muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is well documented that these drugs block muscarinic receptors (which is an acetylcholine receptor), and acetylcholine directly impacts learning and memory.

&gt;*Muscarinic*Â acetylcholineÂ *receptors* in the hippocampus and cortex underlieÂ *memory*Â formation

Summary

So, TCAs are a drug that research has linked with memory impairments and dementia. These drugs interfere with our bodies baseline of norepinephrine and acetylcholine. As with any drug; sometimes they create an optimal effect on a person, as for others, not so much. If a person is too excitable and anxious, a TCA can improve their quality of life (even could improve memory if their extreme anxiety was impairing it), while for another it can make them drowsy and leave a bad impression.

\*Note each drug within the class impacts the degree of these effects a little differently.

**Benzodiazepines**

**alprazolam, xanax, chlordiazepoxide, librium, clonazepam, klonopin, clorazepate, tranxene, diazepam, valium, lorazepam, ativan, oxazepam, serax, temazepam, restoril, triazolam, halcion**

Drug Class

These are commonly considered anti-anxiety medication (though can be used for seizures, insomnia, and muscle spasms). They work by quickly slowing down important parts of our brain.

Lets taco bout it.

This drug class specifically targets the GABA-A receptor, enhancing its effect, which slows down our central nervous system; this makes us feel relaxed, because the drug has retarted a major gear in our system (sometimes this is EXACTLY what we need).

Did You Know?

Anesthesiologists often give Versed (a benzodiazepine) so patients will not remember surgery?

How Benzodiazepines Impact Memory

This drug class changes our mental state &amp; while the drug is advantageously quick acting, the effects linger.Â  Short-term memory is not as affected, but long-term memory is specifically impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. The effects are similar to the long-term effects of alcoholism (alcohol is also a CNS depressant). Both of these substances, used long term actually damage our brain.

This is why a rehab center isnt going to allow the use of 'said drug' while recovering. This is why therapists often (but not always) stray away from patients taking 'said drug' while trying to work on trauma, recovery, etc. If the brain is not functioning &amp; you're not able to remember anything, how can you work on it? The most effective aspects of benzodiazepines are precisely why individuals have a tendency to become dependent on them.

Now, don't shoot the messenger. Obviously, there is a time and a place for benzodiazepines. They're an actual life saver for the (hopefully) occasional panic attack. But how sadistic is that Benzodiazepines have addictive properties, which means that with *repeated* use we will need *increasingly* higher doses, making the dent in your memory more and more indisputable.

Full Disclosure

My mother was an addict, benzodiazepines being her drug of choice.

Do you know an addict whose drug of choice is a benzodiazepine? No SHAME, but if so, you can probably attest that **they dont remember shit.** 

How about an addict whose drug of choice is alcohol? All love here, but you can say for certain, *they dont remember shit*.

There has even been a fair amount of data to support that the risk of Alzheimers is elevated in those taking the drug for over 6 months. One Harvard study even speculated that it would raise the risk by 84%! Seems unrealistic, but who am I to question Harvard; I'll add the link below if you're also feeling speculative.

Another point of concern is that this drug will inhibit your brain from initiating activity of GABA A (since the medication has so kindly been doing it). What this means is that after the drug is long gone from your system, your brain experiences a lag in restoring the normal GABA balance.

This is often what is referred to as *rebound anxiety*Â  because your anxiety is likely to get worse, before it gets better after taking a benzodiazepine, especially if taken long term.

Take it from a nurse who works in mental health; it's not enjoyable being the bystander of a patient trying to escape their benzo addiction.

But this is why the mental health world is increasingly trying to move towards low dosing and only prescribing for a limited amount of time.

Now, Benzodiazepines are very dangerous to quit cold turkey, so please dont go flush yours down the toilet after reading this.

When Benzodiazepines were first discovered they offered an immediate solution to the overwhelming crippling anxiety that many people face, but the harsh reality is that were now in a benzo addiction crisis. Were learning over time, as a society and those changes dont happen overnight. And trust me, as a mental health professional I myself occasionally grow infuriated at the amount of family doctors who prescribe copious amounts of benzodiazepines only to later turn the patient away after addiction has crippled them.

**Anti-Epileptics**

**topiramate, topamax, zonisamide, zonegran, levetiracetam, keppra, pregabalin, lyrica, clonazepam, klonopin, rufinamide, banzel, vigabatrin,Â  sabril, phenytoin, dilantin, oxcarbazepine, trileptal, carbamazepine, tegretol, lamotrigine, lamictal, lacosamide, vimpat, valproic acid, depakote, phenobarbital, gabapentin, neurontin**

Drug Class

Anti-seizure medications are commonly used for mood disorders and even anxiety in addition to epilepsy.

What Do They Do?

Epilepsy is caused by **excessive** hyperexcitability of the nervous system therefore, medications in this class are geared toward minimizing excitability. This drug class actually encompasses three different major classes

1. Blocking Sodium Channels
2. Enhancement of GABA Inhibition
3. Regulation of Synaptic Releases

Why it Impacts Memory

Overall, anticonvulsants work in different ways; trust me I rode the magic school for HOURS trying to gain an understanding of them to write this. Truthfully, we still have a lot to learn about them. Their impact is complicated and the effects range based on the dose and drug.

For instance, Topamax has pretty diverse pharmacologic actions, because of that, it **has** been linked with impaired concentration, cognitive dulling, psychomotor retardation, language and comprehension difficulties, rather extreme effects on short-term memory and working memory, poor verbal fluency and word-finding, reduced IQ scores, abnormal thinking and delayed cognitive speed. Because of this dark cloud of side effects, Topamax is sometimes referred to as 'Dope-A-Max'.

However, a more selective medication within the drug class such as Phenytoin or Tegretol are more specific to blocking sodium channels. Overall, they seem to have less impact on memory and cognitive function.

Many of these drugs listed above have an impact on GABA, and long term exposure to GABA agents can alter the functionality of GABA permanently, which means there are potentially permanent consequences to cognition, behaviors, and memory.

Phenobarbital has been linked to lower IQ, and worse effects than Depakote and Tegretol, however it is actually a barbituate. Its effects are similar to benzodiazepines which you can read more about above.

Gabapentin, used for seizures and often mood disorders, belongs to it's own drug class. Still, it **has** been linked to memory impairment. Hence, the name, it also impacts GABA, which as mentioned several times now, certainly plays a hand in our ability to remember. At this point there isnt enough research to say its linked to dementia though.

As far as drugs for epilepsy, Gabapentin is tolerated much better than many others. Its also worth mentioning that this drug seems to have more *short term* effects on memory. Some will experience a disorienting feeling or short term memory loss while taking Gabapentin, but the reports of long term memory being impacted are reported less often.

**Antipsychotics**

**sometimes referred to as major tranquilizers or neuroleptics; risperidone, risperdal, quetiapine, seroquel, olanzapine, zyprexa, ziprasidone, zeldox, paliperidone, invega, aripiprazole, abilify, clozapine, clozaril, fluphenazine**

Drug Class

Commonly used as the first line treatment for schizophrenia &amp; sometimes used for mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, Tourette's syndrome &amp; Huntington's disease

What Do They Do?

Most drugs in this class work to block Dopamine, though some do impact other chemicals in the brain.

Did You Know?

Oddly enough, memory seems to actually be improved when using an antipsychotic for a person with psychotic symptoms, though there are many that take medications within this class that are not psychotic. So let's talk about that more.

Why It Impacts Memory

First, let's skip back to the purpose of these drugs. Schizophrenia is the **major** psychotic disorder we use antipsychotics for. Some of the main symptoms are delusions, lack of motivation, unusual behaviors, and hallucinations. Dopamine has been thought to regulate our brains understanding of our surroundings and what it all means to us. So, it's to be expected that drugs within this class target Dopamine.

This class is broken up into two categories;

**First Generation (old, typical):** Block Dopamine-2 Receptors, which means they also block acetylcholine, histamine and norepinephrine. which do impact the complex way in which we store memories. \*More movement disorders come with the old ones.

**Second Generation: (new, atypical):** Block Serotonin and Dopamine Receptors\*\*.\*\* Less risk of extra movements, increased risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and weight gain.

What do they all have in common? **They impact Dopamine.** Long story short; A delicate balance of Dopamine is needed for memory to function. Since this class targets Dopamine, it's fair to say it has the potential to alter our memory. Whether that's a good or bad thing is specific to the patient, but it's typically an unwelcome effect.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Antihistamines**

**brompheniramine, dimetane, benadryl, diphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clistin, clemastine, tavist, doxylamine, unisom,Â  hydroxyzine, atarax, vistaril, promethazine, phenergan,Â  triprolidine, triafed**

Drug Class

Commonly used for allergies but also used for anxiety. Antihistamines are divided into different 'generations' &amp; target different histamine receptors in our body.

* H1 Receptors: Found Throughout the Body
* H2 Receptors: Mostly Stomach Acid Secretion
* H3 Receptors: Central Nervous System
* H4 Receptors: Still Being Researched

What Do They Do?

We're actually still learning a lot about histamines but what we do know is that \*\*anti-\*\*histamines are usually anticholinergic; **blocking** receptors for choline. The problem is that we need choline to be readily available to have the ability to learn, understand and remember.

Why it Impacts Memory?

Being that antihistamines are often anticholinergic, they do impair our ability to think, learn and remember. Especially the first generation antihistamines that easily penetrate our brain. We already naturally produce less acetylcholine overtime. This is partly why as we age our ability to remember, think, and learn diminishes. It's widely known that anticholinergics impact memory, thinking, learning, and muscle function. It is also suggested that these drugs increase the risk of developing dementia.

Did you know?

The only drug within this class that can be given intravenously is Benadryl. Since Benadryl is a first generation, it impacts our body in many ways in addition to the reason why it's administered. Since first generation antihistamines are much less specific in their effects, they are affiliated with greater memory impairment. Though, being the only IV antihistamine available, it is still widely used in hospital settings.

Summary

Overall, the effects range. Regarding mental health specifically; Vistaril, hydroxyzine and Atarax are commonly prescribed for anxiety. While your risks are much less severe than benzodiazepines, these are FIRST generation antihistamines. Therefore, they do have a sedating effect (precisely why they can relieve tension) but this is also means they do impair our ability to remember.

An example of second generation antihistamines are Claritin &amp; Zyrtec. Unlike first generation antihistamines, these do not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily. Therefore, they relieve many effects of allergies, but do not have as many sedating properties or memory impairments associated with them. When it comes to anxiety though, Claritin &amp; Zyrtec won't do you much good.

My therapist seemed miffed because my (very conservative regarding medication) psychiatrist upped my pregabalin (100mg to 180 or more a day) and added promethazine 4 times a day (I only asked for a slight increase in pregabalin and to have promethazine liquid because the pills aren't fast enough for a panic attack and I asked for a shorter time frame of increased medication than he chose). 

My therapist seemed miffed and I explained that he did this so I wouldn't suffer so much and wouldn't need any Lorazepam. This lead to her calling benzos ""devil's things"" saying she usually has a hard boundary of not having patients that take them and urged me to never take them again no matter the indication. I must add here that I only take them sparingly and rarely, like the maximum amount I can have in a week is what I take in a year and refused the packaging size I was to be prescribed as too big two times (which she knows) and that I not only have them for psychiatric indications but also neurological indications (which she didn't let me explain). 

As a side note she also tried to convince me my panic attacks are from breathing too fast and too shallow which causes my body stress. She didn't believe me when I said my breathing (outside of being out of breath from exercise or asthma or having extreme pain or a panic attack but in all those cases I make a conscious effort to breath deep and slow) is deeper and slower than that of others which has also been shown in monitoring it at the hospital several times and that I do breathing exercises and have done since before my PTSD diagnosis. She doesn't take the things that help me calm down like my crafts as very useful and wants me to read up on breathing exercises and spend 45min in two sessions per day on them.

I should also mention that she's the only therapist in a very wide distance that works with complex trauma and has been helpful several times and has given me some good advice and homework. Usually she respects when one of her methods or therapeutic theories isn't for me and we work with what works for me (like she offers two psychological systems to explain an issue and work on it and I can choose which works for me, then we focus on that).

After asking for a friend's opinion I decided I won't lie if she asks (and tell her that I prefer to have people who studied medicine decide on my medication while I prefer her and her psychology studies to work on my CPTSD) but not outright tell her that I will follow my doctor's orders regarding medication and that includes the use of Lorazepam under certain conditions.

Has anyone else had a therapist try to mess with their medication or say they refuse patients that take certain medications? What are your experiences and opinions?

Btw I don't want to know what she'll say when she finds out I'm not only prescribed Lorazepam but also diazepam for certain situations (though I could work around that with promethazine and vomex for several years now but if one of my neurological conditions reaches a certain point it's unavoidable) and also an opiate which I also haven't used in months.","CPTSD",46,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/z3i89t/my_therapist_said_she_doesnt_treat_people_that/"

I did a lot of research and read about harm reduction before I decided to try it. I usually take one and a half capsules (so a total of 450mg as each capsule is 300mg). I also take it no more than once a week. I have found that after taking it, I become extremely horny. It basically sends my libido through the roof. I can barely think of anything else apart from sex after taking it. It makes me feel insatiable. 

The horniness lasts for several hours. I can only take it when I'm at home because of the constant hard-on I get from it. I also seem to produce way more precum than usual after I take it. It also delays orgasm for me, which is  another bonus on top of the drastically increased libido I get from it. I would say Pregabalin gives me a pleasant, warm feeling in my body alongside the horniness, but it's not quite the amazing, ecstatic euphoria that a lot of people claim to experience. The increased libido is probably my favourite effect from it.","gabagoodness",22,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gabagoodness/comments/rzhj55/does_anyone_else_get_insanely_horny_after_taking/"

 I've always understood that a crash where you take weeks to get to baseline is fatal to the treatment/recovery process, because you keep getting back to the beginning, but regular PEM that lasts a day or two and can be eased with meds like IV saline, benzos and pregabalin? No big deal?  How do you perceive it?   
How often do you have PEM?   
do you think PEM will always bring us back to the beginning?

After I left rehab - countless psychiatrists, countless different antidepression meds that either did nothing or side effects were so bad I couldn't take them. Also tried therapy, 3 different dudes which in the end also did nothing. Long story short none of them could really find a reason for my depression and drinking so it seemed like they started throwing on random typical reasons like childhood trauma which I recall absolutely none. Childhood trauma seems to always be the thing they go for when they run out of ideas lol. So all of it seems like wasted money sadly. Only good thing to come out of all of this is I got prescribed pregabalin which seems to stabilize my mood a bit so there's that at least.

Even tried other drugs, figured if I'm gonna use to function let it be at least something less harmful but none of them did it. BDO felt closest to alcohol but mess up the dose just by a milliliter and you have a worst scariest blackout ever (nothing that can compare to alcohol, a few hours you remember ABSOLUTELY NOTHING) so I stopped doing it. And now after 4 months I relapsed. Drinking daily since a week now. And it just feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Like I can finally breathe after suffocating all that time. I don't even feel happy but just at ease which is all I want. Hope I can stop myself before I get dependent again, but since last time I'm always prepared with withdrawal benzos and other meds stashed at least so I'll be able to detox myself worst case scenario.

Feel angry right now. I don't even want to be happy, I forgot how that even feels like, I just want to be content. And it seems impossible without this poison. Just pisses me off. Nothing more to say I think, just wanted to vent, thanks to whoever took time to read that.","dryalcoholics",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/dryalcoholics/comments/whfwlv/why_cant_i_feel_just_normal_without_alcohol/"

"96","2022-10-30",1667114846,"No support","Hey Im 32 female, mother of 1 with EDS,degenerative disc disease, ceoliac disease, endometriosis and fibromyalgia. 

I was diagnosed with ehlers Danlos in the U.K. about 4 years ago. I started with appointments every 6 months and a promise of physical therapy. Physio wasnt organised and I didnt have the funds to go privately at the time. Then covid hit and the NHS shut down. In the last 3 years a dr called me once. Thats it. The gp wont see people in person either and they dont have an understanding of my condition so I get general pain care rather than anything specific for EDS. 

Im currently in the Middle East as my husband has a job here. He found me a dr through recommendation. I go and he doesnt listen to me. Asks me a question then repeatedly stops me before I finish. So I feel he doesnt has the whole picture. He has no notes from the U.K.He responds by telling me not to be lazy. To push myself. I have to exercise everyday unless Im in pain. It feels like a slap in the face. After hes pushed and pulled me around pressing every pain spot on my body I just say in the local language. Finished. Im finished. I could feel tears welling up and I had to leave. My husband wasnt understanding why this interaction wasnt positive for me. He could only see that theres someone to help me. I could see someone who wouldnt listen to help me. Something Ive dealt with for 17 years. 

I was forced to come back in for a blood test, X-rays and a physio visit. Im glad I did that. Although going back to the dr after wasnt ideal. 

He was really late. Had a look said my bloods are fine apart from vitamin D where I need 100,000 units once a week. He also prescribed my mydocalm - a muscle relaxant and pregabalin. I know pregabalin is the first choice for nerve pain. However, I have been repeatedly told not to take this by medical professionals. Those who have access to my full medical history. So I said no to that medication. He challenged me and refuses to accept my feelings constantly telling me to take it. Then my husband starts focusing on the fact I mentioned potential birth defects. So Ive now got two men saying well are you getting pregnant this month? The dr was scoffing at me. I could feel myself getting upset again. So I stood up. I have the dr behind a big desk and my husband standing next to me . I wanted some power back. I told my husband look he is mocking me telling me not to cry. Telling me I need to be mentally strong. Its not helping right now. Back story Im very mental health focussed and have managed the last 3 years of pain mostly with mindfulness and yoga. Along side a counselling session. Im usually a very robust person. But something about this dr at this time where I was physically struggling beyond my capacity broke me.

I explain I wont make a decision on that medication without consulting someone in my language. My husband is furious. The dr is rolling his eyes at me saying dont you want to help yourself. In the car on the way home my husband says I dont help myself. I dont exercise. Im on my own in this. 

Truth is the physio routine I was given was mainly yoga type stretches which i do every day for at least 20 mins. I go for a walk almost every day and I lift and carry a 13kg toddler whos not walking I look after him alone 12 hours a day because I have no childcare (best part of my day). I manage a home and the cooking and I work 2 jobs online. I think I do a lot. I think Im pushing myself too much to be honest. 

I dont go to the gym and thats because I dont have anyone for the baby.I cant drive in this country. My husband works 6 days a week and when he gets home works too. So he hasnt given me any time to go to a gym. Hes also insisting I work with his personal trainer and wont accept that I dont feel comfortable with someone whos not a specialist in my condition. Honestly trainers in the past have caused me injuries by pushing me . Dislocations etc are common for me and I all ways end up injured. Resulting in having to carry on my daily life with more pain because I dont get any support at home.

I was told I have arthritis in my spine in the neck middle and lower parts. I also have calcification, bone spores and narrowing. No surgery needed but at 32 this is saddening to hear. 

I guess Im writing this to share with people who may understand how I feel because honestly I couldnt feel more alone. I try to do everything and live a full
Life. Im studying to be a yoga instructor to help myself (my course focuses on anatomy). Im truly concerned about pregabalin &amp; the potential side effects. If you have taken it Id love to hear your experience with it good or bad.

"97","2022-08-23",1661226633,"New to kratom, here's a review of my first order with New Hope Botanicals","Hello ya'll! So I've been looking for relief for massive, persistent anxiety I just can't seem to shake. I've actually done kratom in the past, it was some product I got from a headshop. At the time I was coming off opiates prescribed to me after a surgery, and even though the quality wasn't that great it really helped wean me off the drugs. That was 4-5 years ago and I hadn't done it since.

I'm going through enormous stress in my life at the moment. I quit drinking alcohol as it wasn't helping me any more. I was prescribed gabapentin and pregabalin, but I can't really take them as prescribed because I felt I was getting dependent on them. I've long been a weed smoker, but even that gives me more anxiety than I'd like these days.

So I got interested in getting back into kratom. I found this sub and I was really impressed by the community. I wanted to get a good sample batch to start off with. It seemed like New Hope Botanicals was pretty popular with ya'll,  so I selected three different varieties from them to begin my kratom journey. I chose capsules of Super Green Ultra, White Awake, and Red Bali. When I got my order, I was stoked to see that Jordan had included a sample bag of Super Elephant powder. That was awesome, thank you so much man! Here's my review of the varieties the first time I took them.

Super Green Ultra: I started off with this one as everyone seemed to rave about it. I took 2.5 grams and liked where it was going, so I took another 1.5 grams after about 45 minutes. I was completely blown away! All my anxiety just melted away, I felt super positive. All negative feelings and thoughts went away. It was like I was wrapped in a warm blanket, I felt super sociable as well. It definitely made me super drowsy, I think this one will be good for sleep. This was so much better than the previous kratom experience I had. It was an absolute 10/10.

White Awake: The next morning, I took 2 grams when I woke up as I heard the white strains are good for motivation. It hit me hard and I got the wobbles pretty bad. The sedation was really intense and I had to go back to bed. Since then I've tried 1 gram and that seems to be the dose for me. I'm not a fan of it though, it kind of gives me the jitters and doesn't work well with my body chemistry I think. It's powerful, but I don't think whites are for me. 4/10.

Red Bali: That night, I did a couple of grams. It didn't really seem to do much, maybe I was starting to get tolerance. I ate a couple more grams after an hour and I started to get that wobbly feeling. It wasn't a bad feeling, but it was definitely sedating without any of the euphoria of the Super Green Ultra. It wasn't bad, but it kinda felt one-dimensional. 6/10.

Super Elephant: The next day I went on a 16 mile bike ride (just got a new bike and wanted to break it in) and was feeling really sore but also really high on endorphins. Since the Super Elephant was in powder form I went and got some OJ to mix with it. I did a teaspoon to start, and honestly it didn't taste anywhere as bad as I thought it would. I actually kind of liked it! I immediately got that nice warm happy feeling, and all the aches from the ride went away. I took another teaspoon and my buzz got even better. When I looked at the composition of Super Elephant I saw it was a blend of Super Green Ultra and Ultra White. This white didn't bother me, I could feel that it was a bit less sedating than just taking Super Green Ultra. I think this one will be good for starting the day. It's just a good all around blend. 10/10.

That's my review! I felt like I should give back to the community after lurking for a bit. I'm really impressed with New Hope Botanicals, and am looking forward to trying some more varieties. I'm definitely going to get more Super Elephant and Super Green Ultra! I just placed an order with Dragon's Den and will give a review when I try that out.

I'm (19f) autistic and while I have a hard time understanding social cues I became very perceptive about how doctors see me.
My pediatrician was great. He had a good understanding of my conditions and took it seriously.  His behavior was the point from which I started analyze other doctors. I soon noticed that most doctors where just like ""well tough luck"" and never did anything. Especially in the last year now that I'm over 18 I noticed how the doctors more shifted in the ""you can't be sick"" corner. 

I always have a hard time talking to doctors and let my mom talk which in retrospective was the worst spokesperson I could have chosen. My mom regularly gave them false information including false names of medications (for example saying I take Gabapentin even so I took Pregabalin) and never correcting herself and continuing saying it wrong no matter how often I corrected her.
Additionally my mom always demanded I exaggerate my condition and add stuff to get more benefits.
This was part of how messed up the relationship to my mom was. She expected me to express my pain towards doctors but as soon as I expressed it at home she ridiculed me and even got angry at me if the school sent me home due to a flare up. 


I started at a young age picking up medical terms and I regularly read my files (in my country doctors always have to send their findings to the GP and automatically also send a copy to the patient). More than once I as a child had to explain to a neurologist what syringomyelia is.
As a kid I was so used to doctors visits so much that I always looked at them with happy anticipation.

Just recently when I had to list all my diagnoses I noticed how used I am to long list of what I might have so that I actually thought that 6 diagnoses were way too less while other say that this is very much.","ChronicPain",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/ymt8c7/growing_up_as_autistic_child_with_chronic_pain/"

I have a scientific background so have studied up on the disease and the treatments. I've had many grim and desperate years and some good ones. I've tried everything: all the preventatives, three or four different physical therapies, acupuncture, even disgusting horrible chinese teas made with dirt and beetle shells. I've never identified any triggers other than alcohol. My ups and downs are unpredictable and infuriating. The good years have been when something works well as a preventative and has tolerable side effects. Unfortunately, nothing has lasted being effective for me for more than two years. Currently it takes being on three different preventatives and liberal use of triptans to lead a somewhat normal life. I have learned to live with brain fog. Five years ago nothing worked and out of desperation I went on the keto diet and it cured me for two years then stopped working. Since then it has been a roller coaster with constant juggling of medications and many ups and downs.

Here is my advice for migraneurs: Give up the idea of avoiding medications. If you have chronic migraines get on a preventative ASAP. Especially for the young, and in the beginning, I (and several of my neurologists) believe that the more minutes you spend with a migraine, the more your brain begins to re wire to make the migraine state the new ""normal"". It is imperative to get on a preventative to quiet your brain down and minimize it from becoming difficult to treat. If you are lucky you can find something that works for years. If unlucky, for a shorter period. Again, if lucky and you get on a preventative when relatively young and stay on it long enough to quiet down your brain, you might have some ""no drug"" periods (but don't hold your breath). This is usually a chronic condition, with no cure.

There are many preventatives out there. They are generally divided into three classes  A, B, and C: most studied with most evidence of working, less studied but with evidence of working, and studied, but with no evidence for or against working. 

Class A:divalproex, topiramate, beta blockers (propranolol, metoprolol), and botox

Class B: triptylines  (amitriptyline), venflaxine, butterbur,  Be aware that butterbur contains a substance that can be toxic to the liver and must be removed to be safe. Petadolax is the only one that I know of that has this ingredient removed. It is expensive, two years ago $65 a month

Class C  Fluoxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, protriptyline, verapamil, acetazolamide

Lisinopril and candesartin are either B or C

Magnesium, Vitamine B2 (400 mg/day), and COQ10 are either B or C

CGRP related drugs are new and haven't been studied in detail. Most insurance companies won't cover them until you have fail treatment with up to four prior preventatives.

There are many other drugs that are prescribed by neurologists that are last resorts...not well studied but, what the hell, not often but occasionally successful.

The most commonly prescribed preventative is propranolol. It has fewer side effects than the other class A drugs. Botox is less common because of the cost. Most preventatives do not work in more than 35%-50% of people, so what works for someone else may not work for you. Ditto with the side effects: you may not get the side effects that others complain about. 

About triggers: some people do definitely have triggers and avoiding them helps. Alcohol is probably the most common trigger. Caffeine is a trigger for some, for others it helps. Some people never are successful in identifying triggers. It's worth trying to figure out if you have them.

I'm not providing any info about triptans because I have only taken one (imitrex). It works and I can tolerate it, so I haven't researched other options.

Be aware that people who are successfully treated probably post on Reddit way less that those who are not successfully treated, so it is not useful to draw conclusions from the posters on Reddit. Specifically, yes, there are people who successfully take topirimate (Topomax) and triptylines.

Finally, most of us migraneurs have some degree of depression and anxiety. If you have lived through periods of hell, like I have, then you also have some PTSD. Psychotherapy can be useful.

I really can't imagine living sober, I have underlying issues such as anxiety, ADHD, panic attack disorder and in the past was diagnosed with depression.

I will just take whatever will make me high. I don't care if it's a downer, a stimulant etc. Even though I'm more of a downers person I will go on stimulant binges when I have them.

This is snipped from my annual [year in review](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2022/01/2021-in-review.html) post. The full post is on the link if you're curious about personal stuff. I promise this is the last reflective post for another year lol

&amp;#x200B;

1. [3,4-MD-PCP](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/11/34-md-pcp.html)Â \- Definitely the most interesting drug I took this year. Its hard to really say something short about it or generalize it, because the experiences I had with it varied wildly depending on setting and dose. Precisely what I loved so much about it was that it was inconsistent and hard to define, always full of surprises and novelty. I thought this was going to hit the market soon but it has not yet. Eagerly awaiting when I can restock it and experiment more.Â 
2. [3-Me-PCPy](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/07/3-me-pcpy.html)Â \- This stuff rules it's like dissociative cocaine. Pure recreational rush, stimulating manic dissociation, and a short duration that makes it wonderful for binging. Works as well as a stimulant as it does a dissociative. Great for social settings. Great for low commitment dissociative indulgence.
3. [3-Me-PCE](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/11/3-me-pce.html)Â \- Short and sweet, another wonderful social drug- but it packs a surprising punch when aimed high enough. Introspective and interesting when it wants to be, shallow and simple when it doesn't. Stimulating and invigorating! I think this is a fun and useful one.
4. Pregabalin - I strongly dislike alcohol, mostly for its nasty side effects and unpleasant ingestion. The actual feeling of drunkenness is quite nice, were it not for the persistent headaches and nausea I get. Well Pregabalin gives me that almost exactly. Just the nice lightheaded disinhibition and warm sociability, without the spins and vomiting and splitting skull and terrible flavor. A+ in my book. Also can be somewhat visual which I really enjoy.
5. Zolpidem - A weird one for sure, but reliably very enjoyable. Consistently gives me the ""magic"" I used to feel more often from benzos, a sense of imagination and adventure that I had fallen so deeply in love with. Also a bit scary, I've never blacked out totally but I've definitely been messed up to the point of breaking things or accidentally hurting myself (usually tripping on/smacking myself on things) and not even noticing until the next day. So fun but so dangerous. Doses also seem to affect me wildly, 50 mg has had me at a near blackout and I've also remained fairly lucid and functional up to 130 mg. No idea what's up with that (and this was all from the same batch of genuine pharma from eastern Europe)
6. Temazepam - Probably one of my all time favorite benzos, joining the ranks of Etizolam, Pyrazolam, and Clonazepam. Super useful, in its short duration and that it usually won't leave residual amnesia the next day. Really nice and euphoric and great fun at high doses too. All around a nice time.
7. [1cP-AL-LA](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/07/1cp-al-lad.html)D - A delightful psychedelic, very likely just a prodrug for AL-LAD, but just qualitatively I thought it was a lot more visual. Stimulating and invigorating, but also soft, gentle, and ultimately, a lot of fun! And like I said before, it was intensely visual.
8. [1V-LSD](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/08/1v-lsd.html)Â \- Also probably just a prodrug for LSD, but it felt a different character to me. Maybe that's just a placebo effect, but its up on the list because I love regular LSD so much. I only had one experience with it, it was deep, dreamy, vivid and heavy. Maybe it was just the setting. Who knows. I had a good and valuable time.
9. 2-FMA - Good stimulant for staying awake for a long time, like being at work or something. Can be euphoric at higher doses, sometimes this is nice, sometimes this gets in the way of doing things. I normally just take it to do things or stay focused for a while. Purely functional but if you find stimulants fun you would probably like this at higher doses too.
10. 3-CPM - Near indistinguishable from 3-FPM in every regard, dosage, potency, overall feeling. A gentle and neutral stimulation that is good for staying awake and motivated and aware. Perhaps a bit more euphoric than 3-FPM but otherwise I don't think I could tell the two apart. This is a good thing, I think 3-FPM is pretty cool.
11. Flubrotizolam - Just another fun benzo, reminded me of etizolam but was a bit more sedating. I love etizolam so this is high praise. I've found some fatal flaw or some issue in most benzos I've tried recently, but can't really say much bad on this one.
12. [LSZ](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/04/lsz.html)Â \- An oddly shaped lysergamide. This was long, gentle and mild. It felt like just enough, it felt comfortable and like being in good hands. I had a wonderful time with this one, it's quite euphoric and insightful and easy to navigate. Not extremely visual and not super novel or exciting but objectively something nice and worthwhile.
13. [DOF](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/02/dof.html)Â \- I typically find myself bored with the less visual psychedelics that often feel more like stimulants with a bit of a psychedelic edge. This one though, mild in many regards, felt truly psychedelic in its cutting insight and analytical depth. It made engaging with media or with other people fascinating and memorable. It would be great in a social setting. But still, mostly just offers a mild experience.
14. 2-FA - Short somewhat euphoric but also useful stim. Good for staying awake if I'm feeling tired at some social occasion. Not much to say.
15. 3-FA - Like 2-FA but more euphoric and recreational and less functional. I don't enjoy the stim high much so it goes below 2-FA on my list. oops.
16. [4-HO-PiPT](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/09/4-ho-pipt.html)Â \- Surprisingly vivid and intense, but also quite short lasting. Freaky and alien, just a bizarre wacked out experience for a bit. It's an interesting one in my opinion, I wish it were a little longer.
17. [MiPT](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/08/mipt.html)Â \- At the time I thought this was a really mild and lackluster experience but I keep finding myself coming back to my memory of it, there was something unique that really embedded every moment of that experience deep in my memory, made the experience seem worthwhile. I would love to experiment more with this one, perhaps in the context of consuming some sort of media or reading about a specific topic.Â 
18. [DOPr](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/06/dopr.html)Â \- When I said I 4-HO-PiPT wasn't long enough, I didn't meant this long! This is probably the longest lasting psychedelic I have ever taken. It's novel, interesting, and fun, but also a fucking marathon and a trial. I am glad that I experienced it in all of its glory, and I am content to not feel any need to revisit it. Definitely a treasure if you can find it.Â 
19. Triazolam - This is maybe lower because I only had a few opportunities to ingest it, it's fun, its a short benzo, there's not really much else I can say based on what I experienced. Maybe I'd like it more if I got more acquainted.Â 
20. Hydrocodone - It's an opioid, it's quite euphoric, it is extremely popular for a reason.
21. Dihydrocodeine - Another fun opioid, albeit softer and less intense than Hydrocodone or Oxycodone. Apparently not too common.
22. Rilmazafone - Very useful, but not particularly recreational. Its a great sleep aid, especially when coming down from something stimmy, and it doesnt give me as much next-day amnesia as other benzos do, which can be super helpful sometimes. Otherwise though there isnt much euphoria or anxiolysis or amnesia during its active phase for me, just a bit of sedation.Â 
23. CBN - Cannalogue that is very nice for falling asleep or taking a nap. Not much to say other than that.

24.Â Â”10-THC - Another Cannalogue. Not sure I could distinguish this fromÂ Â”8, which I quite like.Â 

25. Flurazepam - Long and sleepy benzo, metabolizes into norflurazepam and feels just about the same. Not as sleepy as flubromazolam or clonazolam or flualprazolam, just a long soft time.Â 

26. 3C-P - Writing my report for this one currently, but it's a long lasting psychedelic stimulant more than anything else. Fun euphoric psychedelic headspace stretched across a long peak, but otherwise just sort of stimulating.

27. [3,4-DCMP](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/04/34-dcmp-diazepam-flualprazolam.html)Â \- Super potent stimulant that lasts forever, what could go wrong? The linked report is what can go wrong lol. It's good for if I want to be stimmed for a long time, which isn't always appropriate.Â 

28. [MALT](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/12/malt.html)Â \- Short and mild like any base trypatmine would be, surprisingly visual and pleasant at times, but fairly nondescript too.Â 

29. [HXE](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/04/hxe.html)Â \- Heavy and confusing and disorienting dissociative that is hell to snort. It's decent at low doses, at high doses it is an odd vacillation of cool and warm, but it is always deep dark and heavy. I can't really see any way of fitting it into my regular rotation. I feel like I've gotten all I want to out of it.

30. [PiPT](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/12/pipt.html)Â \- Short little psychedelic that didn't leave too much of an impression on me, nothign too remarkable and nothing that feels worth revisiting. Wasn't bad in any way, just unremarkable.Â 

31. Baclofen - Quiet and subtle GABAergic, a step above gabapentin, a bit uncomfortable at high doses. Does not play well with other GABAergics, can cause vomiting :x

32. [DOiP](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/02/doip.html)Â \- Nice psychedelic headspace but a heavy bodyload that was way out of proportion with the other effects. Would probably be nice if it didn't feel so bad physically.

33. Â±-PiHP - Ok fine I have to take back my standard that all pyrovalerones suck. It does still smell like toxic cum. But it's pleasant enough, and most importantly didn't make me feel miserable after the peak wore off. It's a pretty low bar and I don't really love it, but it was better than I expected.

34. Flutazolam - Subtle but long lasting. Not intense or recreational enough for my tastes. Just a low-key amnesia not much else.

35. Mexazolam - Just amnesia and nothing else. Not really a fun or useful benzo unless I want to skip through time and feel nothing about it.

36. Flubromazolam - Too long lasting, too sleepy. I am groggy and blacked out for a day or two. Where's the fun in that. This would be useful if I wanted to kill a stim at its peak and sleep for a while I guess. Otherwise feels like a waste of time.

37. Buprenorphine - It was a decent long lasting opioid except for the time I overshot it and couldn't keep food down for like 2 days. (I can still get high on it because I have no tolerance at all lol)

38. Flunitrazolam - This shit cannot be good for me. Feels like I was tossed right into the depths of withdrawal the moment it wore off, I literally jolted awake in the middle of the night. Felt jittery and overstimulated the whole next day. All bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Need to revisit:

Dexoxadrol: You have no idea how excited I was to finally obtain a sample of this drug. Dioxolanes are super exciting. I've written about them extensively, both [the existing ones](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-dioxolane.html)and [potential future ones](https://nervewing.blogspot.com/2021/01/new-drugs-dioxolanes.html). I believe there is so much unexplored potential in this class of super rare and obscure dissociative and I finally got the chance to try one. Why have I just been sitting on it for months having only done one little trial dose that was definitely too little? Idk just waiting for the right moment to aim higher I guess. One inhibitory issue is that the powder is extremely clingy and difficult to work with without losing a lot. I don't know how to solve this. I will do a big dose and write about it someday.Â 

Â²k-2C-B: Tried once, I was treading warily because of different reports of effects varying wildly across doses for different people. I got mild effects and would definitely aim higher. I would like to do it again around other people, which is hard these days. Haven't found the time.

3-MMC: Tried once, it was just okay. Also want to wait to try again when I'm around other people. I want to know what all the hype is, kinda hoping I don't fall in love with it because of how hard it is to get now.

Codeine: Tried once, as a single dose I scored, in pill form. It was a pretty low dose all things considered and a mild experience. Would love to revisit it in the form of lean lol.

FXE + AD2PV: I tried this mixture as it was sold, I felt the pyrovalerone too much and didn't enjoy it. I am working on figuring out a reliable way to separate and purify the 2 compounds. I will probably revisit FXE in earnest when I have it isolated.","researchchemicals",161,"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/s7g1v9/power_ranking_of_every_new_drug_i_tried_in_2021/"

My doctor suggested going onto it full time and this has been great news for both of my conditions and helped me greatly.

However, the most recent visit to the pharmacy resulted in me being pulled aside into a room and having the resident pharmacists threaten to call the police on me. I later found out this was due to a nurse from CMHT who had written two different quantities of the medication on the same prescription paper that was handed to me (28 ct and 56 ct).

It is now the weekend and I have been given until Monday to produce a corrected prescription paper from the nurse who initially dispensed it to me otherwise I will have the police called on me and, with some rather threatening language on the part of the pharmacists, I have been informed that all my personal information is available and I 'cannot hide'.

What am I to do in this situation? I have been on this medicine before and I have no need to fake a requirement for it, I have to look after my little brother whilst also juggling a university course and now, somehow, have to find a way to find the same nurse who prescribed me this and get what essentially amounts to a confession from this person and a corrected prescription.

Thank you for your help, facing the withdrawals from these whilst this is happening is going to be tough.

"131","2023-01-06",1673034412,"Dear Mr Merion Thomas FRCS","Joseph,

I thought I'd write to you, before you write in the Mail.

I've chosen to write to you, as the embodiment of a generation of doctors who have absolutely no understanding of just how miserable it is to be a junior doctor at the moment. Who worked long hours back in the day, and think that JDs just want more money.

This year will mark my 10th anniversary as a doctor, and I've watched the life of a JD progressively worsen year on year. I've been based in London for most of my training but I've also worked in Australia and I have worked the occasional bank shift in the private sector and had the opportunity to see how things can be better or worse in different systems.

Yes, strike action is about pay, but life as a junior doctor is so much worse in so many ways than how it was in your day.

And yes, I was aware that pre EWTD you and your kin worked long hours, even though you hardly ever mention it. But before you tell me how junior doctors don't know how lucky they are, let me say this.

I worked long hours in Australia,  where there was no EWTD,  about 60 hours a week on average, but as part of a firm structure, how it used to be here. Part of a team, same consultant, same other junior doctors. Going to work was fun; because we had our own patients, we all got on with each other, and the harder we worked, the more patients we discharged, the less work we had to do. Actually I loved it. 60 hours a week in Aus was nothing to 40 hours a week in the current NHS.

Clearly there are limits, clearly some things were unsafe pre-EWTD, but what I'm trying to say here is that working fewer hours isn't ""better"". Juniors do not have a great deal. How things have changed.

Today I see juniors coming in each day, unsure what ward they are going to be on, which team they are going to be placed with, working with people they don't know every day. The shifts just need filling with bodies. Medicine is increasingly senior led, and there are get fewer and fewer opportunities to make decisions,  FY1s spend their morning scribing for ward rounds and their afternoons writing discharge summaries whilst on hold. The software we use looks, like the software you used. Strong Netscape browser on windows 95 vibes. It has been ""improved"" by the bespoke additions of senior non-users to create ""helpful"" popups, compulsory tick boxes, and unpredictable crashes. Most of the computers don't actually work, and those that do are incredibly slow, and missing what you'd probably tell me are luxuries, like spacebars, or mice. I know that many of your generation aren't that tech-savvy, so let me put it in terms you might understand. Imagine trying to write in the notes, but your pen randomly alternates between producing no ink to leaking all over your hand. Management have decided to make the notes out of tissue paper to save money. Every time you pick up a drug chart someone with a megaphone will leap from under the patients' bed to to remind you to ""COMPLETE A VTE ASSESSMENT"", and will snatch the pen out of your hand when to trying to prescribe because ""YOU HAVEN'T REVIEWED THIS PATIENT'S ALLERGY STATUS FOR 24 HOURS"". This will also happen at time critical moments, like cardiac arrest calls.

I'm sad to tell you that the mess exists in name only. The last two places I worked it was't actually in in the hospital anymore. COVID might have been 1a on the certificate, but it had been dying for some time; those weekly mess nights out, mess football teams, big mess parties, especially those in the mess itself - they don't happen anymore. The canteen is no longer a social hub - junior doctors don't know their colleagues as they used to.

During my time in London I have watched JD hospital culture dwindle away, and it is now almost fully extinguished.

Part of this is down to the loss of free hospital accommodation that your generation was afforded. Even if you moved out and bought your first flat as an SHO, and later your 5 bedroom London townhouse for Â£200,000 as your peers so often proudly tell me, as if the price were purely due to skilled haggling. I'd say that around 30% of F1s and F2s I've been working have been living with their parents. This is despite the incredibly generous London uplift which was  Â£2,162 in 1990 but fortunately is Â£2,162  today.

Perhaps you'd like to remind me about how the NHS needs more funding because of the increasingly elderly population, but give no credence to how these changing demographics have affected the reality of life as a junior.

Atorastatin, Rivaroxaban, Losartan, Dapagliflozin, Semaglutide, Ivabradine, Pregabalin, Eplerenone, Clopidogrel, Leveteracitam - none of these drugs were available in 1990 - I'm sure there are many other examples. The entire sub-specialty of interventional radiology barely existed, and you never knew the joy of trying to contact them. Patients just did not live as long, and were not as complicated, expectations were different.

Lots of the quick and easy, but rewarding things to deal with are just not encountered in hospital any more, and in primary care these are delegated to non-medical-school trained colleagues, leaving doctors with the tricky, and often, dare I say it, heartsink patients.

Autonomy and control have been progressively removed from trainees. It is now pick 2 (at most) of where you work, what ward/team you work on and being in training. Apply for the jobs you want where you want and go for interview? That is so pre 2004 lol (that means laugh out loud).

There simply isn't the time for me to talk about student loans, lack of training opportunities, eportfolio, the erosion of the position of a doctor in our society.

I can't help but thinking of Seligman's dog when I look at the life of a current junior doctor.

Placed in a hospital they didn't pick, in a job they may not particularly want to do, with people they don't really know. The camaraderie is gone. Decision making has gone. Pushing around a computer which has been in the NHS since before they were in medical school, using crappy software to write the stressed out plan from the stressed out consultant who doesn't have time to learn their names, never mind provide any form of teaching during the ward round. Stressed out patients and stressed out relatives and stressed out nurses and stressed out pharmacists, all demanding their attention. Calling the stressed out SpRs who might sound a more stressed than they would like. On a background of stress about finances, how to buy a house, go on holiday, have children with a massive student loan and a lousy salary and a meager 2% pay rise in a cost of living crisis.

And you wonder why they're striking? Trust me - it was not worse in your day. This happened under your watch.

Paraphrasing the text of the Controlled Substances Act [here:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812)

**Schedule I:** High potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, no safe use under medical supervision. *(e.g. cannabis, DMT, GHB, heroin, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, psilocybin)*

**Schedule II:** High potential for abuse, has an accepted medical use, abuse may lead to severe psychological of physical dependence *(e.g. Amphetamines, short-acting barbiturates, cocaine, most opioids (fentanyl, codeine, morphine, hydrocodone, etc), PCP)*

**Schedule III:** Lower potential for abuse than Schedule I/II, has an accepted medical use, abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence. *(e.g anabolic steroids, intermediate-acting barbiturates, buprenorphine, ketamine, marinol)*

**Schedule IV:** Lower potential for abuse than Schedule III, has an accepted medical use, abuse may lead to limited physical or psychological dependence. *(e.g. benzodiazepines, long-active barbiturates, pentazocine, modafinil, tramadol)*

**Schedule V:** Lower potential for abuse than Schedule IV, has an accepted medical use, abuse may lead to limited physical or psychological dependence *(e.g. cough suppressants with codeine, pregabalin)*

Before LDN, I was icing my bad knee 4-5 times per day, never leaving the house unless absolutely necessary, couldnt stand up for very long due to my knee and hip pain, and couldnt work more than a few hours per day just sitting at my computer. My pain was a baseline level of 5/10, and went up from there quite often. My partner was massaging me twice per day, often for two hours each time, just to keep me able to hold down my job. My physical therapist was regularly threatening to stop seeing me because I wasnt making any progress and couldnt do hardly anything he asked me to. 

Now, I absolutely NEVER ice my knee, and its fine. Im able to stand and walk for hours and house. Im able to work at my computer as long as I need to. Im able to sleep on my side without severe pain, which is just insane. Im able to let the cats into my bedroom at night, because it no longer causes me extreme pain if a cat lays on me. My partner only massages me once per day for only one hour. Im able to actually do everything my physical therapist tells me to, and Ive been able to use light dumbbells for the first time in years. Oh also chronic fatigue is mostly gone. My pain is a baseline of 0-2, and I actually spend at least an hour or two every day without pain, which is a serious blessing. Im able to go out in public and hang out with friends for hours and hours without issue. I can handle being n the car for at least a few hours, which was NOT the case before. 

I hope Im not speaking prematurely, but I seem to have found my miracle drug. LDN has given me 70-80% of my life back. Im still taking 150mg of pregabalin 3x daily, 5mg baclofen 3-4x daily, 15mg meloxicam once daily, and various OTC supplements. I plan on asking my doctor to try lowering the dosages and/or frequency of all these meds, with the hope that maybe LDN will be enough without quite as much else going on. Well see what he says. 

If youve been considering trying this out, please do yourself a favour and try it. Im well aware it doesnt work quite as well for everyone, unfortunately. By the way, the only side effects Ive noticed are vivid dreams and an increased sex drive, both of which I consider to be good things. Obviously Im not yet where I need to be, since I still rely so heavily on massage, but things are finally starting to look up :)","Fibromyalgia",80,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/xhcfdq/low_dose_naltrexone_has_completely_changed_my/"

I (26F) was at work, which is a physiotherapy clinic last Friday. I had some physiotherapy done on me from a co-worker around 12 PM. I have been seeing this physiotherapist for about a month now for calf cramping and lower back pain.

The physiotherapist did some manual work on my legs and back, dry needled 2 areas in my glutes and gave me some exercises to go home with.

Later that evening around 6 PM, while still at work, I felt a very sudden sharp (almost like a lightning bolt) pain in my lower back that shot down through both my legs. I immediately went to see the physiotherapist and told her what happened. She had me lay in one of the rooms to find a comfy position, but no position relieved the pain. I tried to stand up after about 10 min of laying down and my legs were completely numb and i couldn't support myself. I laid back down and then completely blacked out and woke up in an ambulance.

While in the emergency room on Friday night, I underwent an MRI for my Spine. The report concluded that everything was normal. The doctor then had neurology come take a look and they concluded that this extreme numbness/weakness in my legs was not due to any neurological illnesses. Blood tests came back normal with a slightly high WBC and slightly low Neutrophil count. Nothing of significance. Urine test came back normal as well. (I have missed my period for 4 months, but the urine test confirmed that I was not pregnant.

I was admitted to internal medicine yesterday morning and my legs still have not improved, despite 1 session with the physiotherapist and occupational therapist. Both feet feel constantly like pins and needles and my legs feel no sensation at all (it's like when you fall asleep on your arm and its completely numb and doesn't feel like your arm anymore).

I need assistance to do ANYTHING! Especially going to the washroom, where they lift me onto a commode and wheel me to the washroom and help me pull my underwear down and everything.

I still have total control over bowel movements and urine output.

Doctors are stumped and are telling me they think this is more of a ""software"" issue rather than a ""hardware"" issue.

I feel very hopeless because I'm not making any progress, my lower back is in constant pain (they keep giving me tylenol and advil) for pain  which doesn't work at all. I started pregabalin 2 days ago but haven't noticed too much of a difference.

If you have any ideas or advice or thoughts, please help!

"211","2022-12-05",1670241775,"Feeling betrayed by psychiatrist. He's denying the diagnosis I feel is correct.","So I've known for several years that I have C-PTSD. I was the scapegoat of narcissistic parents that wanted complete obedience or else.... I couldn't do that so I was abused. Mentally, emotionally, verbally, you name it, even sometimes physical. And I was blamed. Whenever they had been violent with me, it was my fault in their opinion, because I made them do that. 

So I developed symptoms. Extreme sound sensitivity, constant hyper vigilance, autoimmune issues, cancer at 24 (32 now and thankfully well physically), extreme startle response, toxic shame, self hatred, fear of people etc... You all know the symptoms. 

So fast forward to this spring. I was breaking down. Completely dissociated and in constant suffering. Overwhelmed by everything. I got an acute appointment with a psychiatrist. At first we discussed autism because of my sound sensitivity. He said I'm not autistic. Then we tried ritalin to see if I have ADHD. That just made me more stressed. I don't relate to them at all. I feel like the symptoms I have/had that LOOK like it, are caused by the trauma and hyper vigilance. We eventually found a medication that works, pregabalin. It takes away the constant panicky stress I was feeling. I'm more stable now.  We got into my childhood and I told him everything. He validated me. I thought that finally someone is seeing what I've been through and not thinking anything is wrong with me. 

And so today I just had my last appointment with him because he's retiring. He said he can't give me C-PTSD diagnosis and then he says my diagnosis is TRAITS of autism and ADHD. Like what does the even mean. We talked for an hour. I cried. He couldn't do anything. I told him I left more confused than when I came in. He said he hopes it clears up with time. Outside of his offices I broke down crying on the stairs. Felt despair. Started hitting myself. I feel so betrayed. It's like he just did to me what my parents did, my greatest fear, telling me it's something wrong with ME. I have been dissociated since. Crying on and off. I felt so hopeful about him. I don't know what to do.

Has anyone tried anything similar? I don't know where to go from here.  

Edit to add: it just occurred to me that this psychiatrist may actually be lazy and just want to get me out because he's retiring. I don't know the cause, but he left some very big holes in his explanation to me, which I'm finding now to seem very negligent. So he explained the autism/ADHD traits with my sound sensitivity and adversity to smells. Though how does it explain the years of dissociation, depersonalization, feeling like a ghost, derealization, feeling like the world is in a fog that I can't see through, being separated from my soul, only living in the thoughts, being afraid of people, being constantly hyper vigilant, chronically tense body, toxic shame, feeling gross, dirty, ugly, stupid, worthless. Ok, I guess I don't know if those are normal with autism, I just know it's from trauma for me. 

The first smells I couldn't stand were my abuser face creme and her cosmetic things like lipstick and things in that category with a certain smell. And I wonder why I would be sensitive to sounds when at any time in childhood I might hear thundering footsteps coming to my door to yeal at for something I didn't do or something I did do, but did wrong. So yeah... It seems like trauma to me, also since I don't have all the other issues with autism/ADHD, it's solely based on the sensitivity to stimuli.","CPTSD",152,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/zd50e6/feeling_betrayed_by_psychiatrist_hes_denying_the/"

24F 59 70kg, English living in Scotland, smoke a pack / 2 days, drink a bottle of wine over a week, meds: terbinafine, folic acid, pregabalin. Diagnosed anxiety and depression

I have tried to off myself a few times in the past, some recent. Most time Ive tried with a belt or dressing gown belt or rope or even asking my partner to choke me so hard I pass out. Ive broke out in spots (which I now know is petechiae) a few times. Once I tried with a boat load of sleeping tablets and alcohol and woke up with vomit all over me.

Is it possible these attempts have left me brain damaged or physically harmed in any other way long term. Ive been living mostly fine since and get by at my work as a night shift care assistant. I do feel like Im slow sometimes. It takes me longer to understand people, I wont get jokes a lot of the time and just laugh and pretend I understand (which I know everyone does but I feel like I dont understand people at all sometimes). I feel stupid, it takes me a long time to learn. And even when Ive learnt it Ill forget things or continue to be slow at it. My focus is horrendous and has been for sometime. I can hardly focus on a video game or show anymore and Im often distracted. My memory is atrocious, worse than my friend who has had a stroke and says his memory has been affected by it.

I dont believe this is the pregabalin as I had these issues before and the pregabalin has been the best medication Ive had for my anxiety (which is the reason Ive tried to off myself in the past). My anxiety is well managed at the moment and Im content with the way it is. I dont feel suicidal at all recently.

I know people will try and push me to seek help for my suicidal actions but please know I am in therapy. I have an amazing therapist who has helped me immensely and is part of the reason I am where I am today, holding down a job and my own flat. We are working through schematherapy. I am in contact with a psychiatrist also and have an appointment with him on the 17th of this month to discuss some other symptoms Ive been having (hallucinations). This post though is just to ask if its possible and/or likely I have permanently harmed myself by these attempts. Is it likely Ill have brain damage? Im being pushed for an mri on my brain so hopefully that will give me some answers too.

My doctor suggested going onto it full time and this has been great news for both of my conditions and helped me greatly.

However, the most recent visit to the pharmacy resulted in me being pulled aside into a room and having the resident pharmacists threaten to call the police on me. I later found out this was due to a nurse from CMHT who had written two different quantities of the medication on the same prescription paper that was handed to me (28 ct and 56 ct).

It is now the weekend and I have been given until Monday to produce a corrected prescription paper from the nurse who initially dispensed it to me otherwise I will have the police called on me and, with some rather threatening language on the part of the pharmacists, I have been informed that all my personal information is available and I 'cannot hide'.

What am I to do in this situation? I have been on this medicine before and I have no need to fake a requirement for it, I have to look after my little brother whilst also juggling a university course and now, somehow, have to find a way to find the same nurse who prescribed me this and get what essentially amounts to a confession from this person and a corrected prescription.

"241","2022-06-25",1656158407,"10 years of polydrug abuse, and counting","DISCLAIMER: PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT.  I EXPECT LAUGHTER AND PITY, NOT ADMIRATION OR EMULATION.  PROFESSIONAL DRIVER ON CLOSED COURSE.

I have just hit the 10 year mark on my ongoing polydrug (ab)use.  I have mostly stuck to a system with a three-day rotation of drugs.  Day 1 is opioids, Day 2 is benzos, and Day 3 was originally cannabis.  (Actually, I used cannabis on all the days, so day 3 was sort of a rest day.)

Later, I discovered pregabalin and Day 3 became that, eventually replaced by 4-methyl-pregabalin.

The opioid I started with was oxycodone.  This was ten years ago, when it was easy to get legit oxy pills without fentanyl on DNMs.  After five years or so I got tired of the oxy and replaced it with tapentadol.  After that, there was a year or two where it was kratom, then a period of o-DSMT.  Now it is heroin mixed with tapentadol.

Benzos used have been diazepam, diclazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, zolpidem, clonazelam, and probably others I am forgetting.  Zolpidem is by far my favorite (I know, it's technically not a benzo).  Typically I mix a bunch of these on the benzo day.

But wait, there's more!  I am not just a downer guy.  I supplement the above regimen with stimulants, taken between once and three times a week.  Original stim was adderral or dextroamphetamine.  Then there was a long ethylphenidate period (it is a very underrated stim).  Also 4f-MPH (which I didn't like nearly as much), 2-FA, 4-FA, some pyrros (brief, they were too compulsive), and now, low doses of meth (no higher than 25 mg rectal).

I also do dissociatives irregularly, maybe 5-10 times a year.  My living situation is such that I can only do these when one of my housemates is out of town.  I typically do the dissos on ""benzo night,"" using the benzos to come down from them.

Psychedelics are used rarely and with decreasing frequency; they just give me far too much anxiety.  Ones used during this period were 2C-B, alpha-methyl-tryptamine, and 5-Meo-DIPT.

I used cannabis and alcohol along with the substances described every night, as well.  I realize the alcohol is a terrible combination, and urge people not to try it.

This decade-long thing started when I discovered Silk Road in 2012.  It's also worth noting that the decade I am documenting here was not my 20s; in other words, I am not as young as most of you.  I did do a lot of drugs before this period, but irregularly, and mostly cannabis, alcohol, and psychs.

What have been the results?  I'll start with objective evidence.  Throughout the period, I have been employed as a software engineer at several firms, some of them very high profile.  I never received a negative performance evaluation, I got several promotions, and have seen my salary rise.  I did quit my last job about a year ago and have not gotten another one (by choice); this was for personal reasons that didn't have anything to do with drugs.

I am in the same marriage that I was when this all started.  I am ashamed to say that my spouse only knows about the cannabis and alcohol.  I have hidden everything else from them.  Despite that, I think our relationship is better than it was before this all started.

Subjectively, things are not as good, but it's unclear to me just how much I have declined, and how much of it I can attribute to drugs, as opposed to aging (again, I am not a spring chicken).  I have been depressed my entire life, bordering on suicidal, and that has continued.

Somewhat to my surprise, I am not physically dependent on any of the drugs.  There have been several instances in this period when I went on weeks-long vacations and didn't bring any substances.  I experienced no physical withdrawal.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I have stepped up my dosages of many of these chems by slight amounts during the course of the decade.  It's not out of control; more like increasing the dose by 25% or so every few years.

I have also become a raging addict as a result of these ten years.  (If anyone reading this doesn't know the difference between addiction and dependency w/r/t drugs, you should look into it.)  On those drug-free trips I mentioned, I was constantly looking forward to getting home and getting high.  Not surprisingly, the opioids and the stims give me the most trouble.  I find excuses to schedule additional opioid nights, for example.

tldr, in conclusion, took a mix of drugs (including the very most addictive ones) for ten years daily.  Amazed I am in as good a shape as I am, but have a huge psychological addiction problem.  Abstractly want to quit, but not enough yet to actually do it.  Would not recommend this for anyone else and would not repeat.","researchchemicals",99,"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/vkdje4/10_years_of_polydrug_abuse_and_counting/"

SECURITY i yelled and tried to run but he catches me.  Now i am in his office absolutely barred out, im slurring my words and i lied about my name. Police comes and takes me to their car after the talk and nobody could find any info about the guy i said i was so they take me to the station, my memory is starting to get really blurry at this point but i remember when they put me in the cell and i slept the high off.

Lets first try to understand the meaning of the words. Occipital is in reference to the area of the head that experiences the pain (we will get more into this in a bit)- the occipital region or the posterior scalp and upper neck. Neuralgia is in reference to the neuropathic pain experienced in said area.

The affected areas of the skin are those mainly supplied by the greater, lesser, or third occipital nerve. The greater occipital nerve corresponds to the medial branch of the C2 dorsal ramus, the lesser occipital nerve correspods to the C2 ventral ramus,  and the third occipital nerve arises from the medial branch of the C3 dorsal ramus.

The branches of the cervical spinal nerves that innervate the cutaneous regions of the back of the scalp and upper neck (medial branches of the dorsal rami of cervical nerve roots C2, C3, C4, and sometimes C5).

Check the picture below to make more sense of it. I highlighted the branches Im referring to. (Note that posterior rami is just another name for dorsal rami).

**Pain description:**

* Occipital neuralgia pain is generally a stabbing, electric, or shooting quality of a paroxysmal nature.
* The pain can come on suddenly and spontaneously but can also start due to sensation to the area (combing/brushing hair, collar/turtleneck, etc.) or movements like hyperextension or rotation of neck (pillow sign).
* There are no OBJECTIVE neurological deficits
* Possible associations with other abnormalities, such as, dizziness, nausea, nasal congestion, tinnitus, visual impairment, and ocular pain.
* The area affected may have abnormal, unpleasant sensations that arent painful (dysesthesia). This also includes- seemingly contradictory- diminished sensation to the area.
* Chronic dull pain possible between flares
* Unilateral&gt;bilateral
* Possible decreased physiologic range of motion. No anatomic range of motion changes.

**Diagnostic Criteria according to the ICHD-3:**

*Description:Unilateral or bilateral paroxysmal, shooting or stabbing pain in the posterior part of the scalp, in the distribution(s) of the greater, lesser and/or third occipital nerves, sometimes accompanied by diminished sensation or dysaesthesia in the affected area and commonly associated with tenderness over the involved nerve(s).Diagnostic criteria:*

1. *Unilateral or bilateral pain in the distribution(s) of the greater, lesser and/or third occipital nerves and fulfilling criteria B-D*
2. *Pain has at least two of the following three characteristics:*
   1. *recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a few seconds to minutes*
   2. *severe in intensity*
   3. *shooting, stabbing or sharp in quality*
3. *Pain is associated with both of the following:*
   1. *dysaesthesia and/or allodynia apparent during innocuous stimulation of the scalp and/or hair*
   2. *either or both of the following:Â a)Â tenderness over the affected nerve branchesÂ b)Â trigger points at the emergence of the greater occipital nerve or in the distribution of C2*
4. *Pain is eased temporarily by local anaesthetic block of the affected nerve(s)*
5. *Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.*

**Notes on diagnostic criteria:**

* Referred pain must be ruled out.
* Palpation may show tenderness, paresthesia, or general discomfort along the distribution of the affected nerves.
* Tapping on affected nerves may also elicit pins and needles feeling. (Tinels sign).
* If the pain does not improve or resolve via occipital nerve block (ONB) then occipital neuralgia is ruled out.
* Resolution with ONB alone does not confirm occipital neuralgia as several other headache disorders may improve with ONBs.
* Other referred pain disorders may cause the same or similar pain- especially cervicogenic headache. See: [https://www.cerebraltorque.com/blogs/migranews/treatment-of-cervicogenic-headache](https://www.cerebraltorque.com/blogs/migranews/treatment-of-cervicogenic-headache)
* Neuroimaging suggested to rule out other possible causes (head and cervical spine MRI).

**Possible cause of ON (no good evidence):**

Compression and/or irritation of the greater, lesser, or third occipital nerve. This may be due to several factors including chronic muscle contraction or nerve entrapment- among several others.

**Treatment:**

* Occipital Nerve Block (an anesthetic with a corticosteroid, usually). If corticosteroids used, there should be a 3-month interval between injections.
* Other options, with limited evidence, include gabapentin, pregabalin and/or baclofen, and carbamazepine.
* Consider neck collar for immobilization if ON is secondary due to acute trauma.
* For refractory pain with limited response to conservative measures, consider Botox, pulsed radiofrequency, occipital nerve stimulation.
* For severe cases refractory to other treatments, consider occipital nerve stimulation, occipital nerve surgical decompression.

**Alternative Treatments:**

* Physiotherapy","migraine",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/y28siw/i_wrote_an_occipital_neuralgia_on_reference/"

"331","2022-02-07",1644216008,"PSA: Gabapentin and pregabalin are NOT GABAergics","OK this needs to be said because I see so many people confusing it. These four drugs are NOT GABAergic. GABAergic means *affects or modulates the GABA system directly*. Pregabalin and gabapentin  may be *derived* from the GABA structure, but that doesn't make them GABAergic. This is only a chemical relation; not a pharmacological one. Phenibut and GHB are technically GABAergics, but it's actually not their most potent mechanism of action of either!

Now, if you don't care about why this is the case, then skip to the TL;DR. But if you do care about what you're eating grams of for dinner every night, then read on.

Let me explain the difference. The selective gabapentinoids (pregabalin and gabapentin) are N-type alpha 2 delta voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitors, or for short, a2d VGCC blockers. By blocking voltage-gated calcium channels, these drugs inhibit the calcium influx into a presynaptic neuron whenever this neuron fires an action potential. Calcium is the primary way that neurons know when to release neurotransmitters. So, without calcium, the neuron doesn't traffic over its quantal vesicles full of neurotransmitter goodies to the axonal bouton and shit them out into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. \[This is my very, very bad attempt at humor.\] In other words, the neuron doesn't release neurotransmitters. This leads to a net inhibitory effect on transmission.

GABAergics can be split twofold: into GABA-A and GABA-B receptor ligands. Benzodiazepines and carisoprodol are GABA-A positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) (albeit there is a difference between these two which I'll get into below). Phenibut is a VGCC most potently, so what I said above about gabapentinoids also applies to phenibut (which itself is a gabapentinoid). However, phenibut is also a GABA-B agonist. GHB agonizes the GHB receptor (yes it's named after the drug--sexy) most potently, but also the GABA-B receptor. (The GHB receptor is stimulating in lower doses of GHB, and GABA-B gets activated to create sedation in higher doses of GHB.)

What do each do? GABA-A is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel. Chloride (Cl-) has an inward concentration gradient (and an outward electrostatic gradient, but we won't get into that); this means that chloride flows into the neuron when it's activated. Chloride has a charge of -1. This has the effect of hyperpolarizing the neuron whenever the GABA channel is activated. Hyperpolarizing means making more polarized, or negative in this case. Neurons need a depolarization (aka more positive) in order to reach the threshold of excitation (this sounds sexual but isn't, trust me) before having an org--firing an action potential (phew). Thus, GABA activity decreases the chance that a neuron will fire. This leads to a net inhibitory effect.

Benzos as GABA-A PAMs do not activate GABA-A receptors directly. They bind to the side of the receptor (allosterically) and increase the ability of GABA to bind to the receptor. This means that they can't do things on their own; they require GABA to cause an effect. By increasing the GABA-A receptors's affinity for GABA, the neuron will hyperpolarize more often because GABA binds more frequently. Carisoprodol metabolizes to meprobamate, a no-longer-prescribed carbamate. These are more similar to barbiturates than benzodiazepines. These drugs increase the amount of *time* the GABA-A receptor is open, on top of doing what benzos do. Longer opening time means more Cl- can flow in, leading to greater hyperpolarization and an even lower chance the neuron fires. They bind allosterically, like benzos, but can also cause activation of the GABA-A receptor themselves. This means they *don't even need GABA to cause an effect*! This leads to barbiturates, carbamates, carisoprodol, etc. being much more deadly than benzos in overdose.

GABA-B receptors are metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors. GABA-B receptors are coupled (aka attached) to Gi/o proteins, GIRKs (G-protein coupled inwardly-rectifying K+ channels), and VGCCs actually. The first thing, Gi/o coupling, means that it inhibits adenyl cyclase, which leads to the neuron having less cAMP (which is a signaling molecule), leading to less signaling within the neuron (not the same as action potentials; neurons are cells and have a wide variety of processes within them). The second thing is probably the most famous for GABA-B. Activation of the GABA-B leads to activation of these GIRKs. These K+ (potassium) channels have outward concentration gradients. Since K+ is positively +1 charged, then activation of GABA-B leads to K+'s positive charge leaving the neuron. This means hyperpolarization, aka less neuronal firing, but you already knew that from before since you're smart now! Lastly, the inhibition of calcium channels you also know what that does (releases less neurotransmitters).

So, overall, gabapentinoids inhibit neurotransmitter release and GABA ligands slow neuronal firing (GABA-B ligands like phenibut and GHB in higher doses have some overlap, but GABA-B is closer to GABA-A than VGCCs; benzos are the most different). Yes, they're similar in that they're both inhibitory. But that's where the similarities end. **What neurons and neuronal circuits (and therefore what effects) each is involved with is different because GABA receptors and VGCCs are expressed in varying amounts by brain region.** Further, they inhibit neurons in entirely different ways. This is the point I wanted to make, but I got sidetracked in explaining the differences in depth. Hope you learned something!

TL;DR: Gabapentin and pregabalin are voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitors and benzodiazepines are GABA-A positive modulators. They affect different areas of the brain, leading to distinct effects. However, they both inhibit neurobiological transmission, so there is *some* overlap.","gabagoodness",64,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gabagoodness/comments/smjir7/psa_gabapentin_and_pregabalin_are_not_gabaergics/"

I used 2-FMA for work, I was glued to my PC writing code for 12h straight. Then I would take a bunch of Pregabalin to sleep.

When I decided to quit, I discovered that it was very hard for me to sit down and work. I work from home, so I stayed in bed most of the time and did the bare minimum to not get fired.

I did nothing compared to what I was capable of while high on 2-FMA. Back then I could write the most beautiful reports, and create the most beautiful charts.

Now it's a struggle to even sit down and reply to an stupid email.



So my addict mind started looking for alternatives:

Modafinil in very high doses (450-600mg) worked. I was able to concentrate and work without motivating myself. But the downside was that I couldn't sleep for 48 hours, not even taking Seroquel or Mirtazapine.

I live in South America, so I decided to try chewing coca leaves with sodium bicarbonate. It definetely had an effect, but the effect was mostly sweaty hands and having anxiety.

It didn't work for intellectual tasks because of the anxiety I would get from chewing coca leaves. But I discovered that it worked quite well for phsyical tasks like cleaning the kitchen or taking care of my room.

Then I tried coca-leaves + alcohol. Goddamn, it can get pretty euphoric. I'm high with a ball of coca leaves inside my cheek and drank 1/4 of a Pisco bottle (equivalent to a Vodka bottle).

I get euphoric, no anxiety, I can work, but the comedown it's pretty damn awful. It's like a comedown from coke, I only want to kill myself during the comedown.

So I resort back to my comfort drug: Pregabalin. I take high doses to take the edge off the coca leave+alcohol comedown.

I'm fucked","researchchemicals",70,"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/ygbiqr/coca_leaves_alcohol_the_need_to_get_high_is_still/"

Ofc since im here, u know im also wumbo ADHD, and sifting through old posts is difficult for me. If anyone feels im being redundant, i wont be offended by lack of reply d (i also hope redundancy isn't considered rude on reddit im newish still)

 im 24m and i literally am going to apply for unemployment due to fibro. It has robbed me of the last 2+ years of my life. Lost my girlfriend, ability to work, my fucking personality, dropped out of school, and oh, im a man, so ofc fibro took TWO YEARS of daily appointments to figure out. This is a garbage can of a condition haha. I was extremely high performing in school, brilliant business man, making that bank, 240lbs of muscle, and then i got EBV...

 wo-man. I mean evvvvverything changed. Straight up died inside. But the brain is smart like that. If it kills the person in the body, it protects them from the body's pain. I started 50mg pregabalin 3xdaily about 3 days ago. Holy shit holy shit. I didnt even realize what i was going through. Maybe hell on earth? Tbh i doubt hell even comes close to fibro. I send love to every woman and man in here.

I do have some questions and curiosities though, if anyone is willing to entertain them :)

For this post: with thousands of you in this sub, i would love to hear your stories about pregabalin, and how long it worked for you. Basically i have not yet seen evidence of anyone being happy with their dose for more than a year and that terrifies me. I am obvi a lil high from it rn cuz im a pregab virgin (recently not i guess hehe) but the high doesnt interest me. What id love to know is how many of you started on a similar dose to mine (150mg divided into three doses for the day, each dose is a 50mg CAPSULE, not tabs) and were able to stay somewhere close for the long term? In otherwords i dont want to take 600mg of this stuff ever, and i just dont ever want to experience what ive experienced over the last two years of my life's prime. I was hopeless. This med changed that. Anyone out there who made it work for the long run? Would love to know :)

Also accepting just ANY fibro advice because as im sure you're all aware, it took until now to ""let myself be suffering"" as much as i was, as opposed to the chronic imposter syndrome of the last two years (and tbh i mightve been born with fibro as i also have connective tissue disorders and had fucking sciatica pain by 13yrsold). But hey that imposter syndrome! Likely just the EBV made my fibro worse, to the point it felt like something altogether new.

Im really excited to own this. Im ready to get my life back. I really didnt think i ever would.

"431","2022-02-18",1645225028,"Phenibut's effects are often attributed to its its Â±2Â´ activity, yet its affinity for this target is 620x weaker than gabapentin. Can anyone justify this?","[Zvejniece et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26234470/) found that the Â±2Â´ affinity of R-phenibut, S-phenibut, and gabapentin were 23, 39, and 0.05 Â¼M, respectively. This implies that at a concentration of 0.05 Â¼M gabapentin, half of the Â±2Â´ receptors would be bound to gabapentin. Assuming we have racemic phenibut, a 31 Â¼M concentration would be required to occupy half of the Â±2Â´ receptors.

The problem is that 31 Â¼M is a 620x higher concentration than 0.05 Â¼M, yet the actual doses of phenibut and gabapentin aren't all that different (according to PsychonautWiki the common doses of phenibut and gabapentin, respectively, are 1-2g and 0.9-1.5g).

Probably the first thing that comes to mind is that phenibut might have better absorption. However,  due to their zwitterionic nature at physiologic pH, neither gabapentin nor phenibut would be expected to undergo passive transcellular transport. Some evidence for this is that [plasma levels of gabapentin don't increase proportionally with dose, which suggests a saturable transport mechanism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8456077/). Additionally, [an in vitro study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11095-018-2532-0) suggests that pregabalin (another zwitterionic Â±2Â´ ligand) enters brain endothelial cells via LAT1.

Now where I'm going with this is that if phenibut's bioavailability is similarly saturable, why would we expect it to produce brain concentrations which are 620x higher than a similar dose of gabapentin?

The only possible explanation I've been able to come up with is that phenibut's binding might take longer to reach equilibrium than gabapentin. If the binding assays weren't at equilibrium, they would have overestimated the IC50 for \[^(3)H\]gabapentin displacement, and consequently the Ki they gave for phenibut would have been overestimated as well.

Two studies have measured phenibut's Ki, both using similar conditions. [One study incubated for 30 min and found a Ki of 60 Â¼M](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1016/j.pharep.2015.12.004), while the other that I mentioned above incubated for 40 min and found a Ki of 31 Â¼M. This already suggests that the one of these studies didn't allow phenibut binding to reach equilibrium, and as a result overestimated the Ki by a factor of 2. The only way to ensure equilibrium is reached is to vary the time of incubation, and it doesn't appear either study did this. The literature mentions that binding assays which failed to reach equilibrium have resulted in anywhere from 7- to 1000-fold Kd overestimations.

Also, there's some completely anecdotal evidence for this. According to PsychonautWiki, the onset of gabapentin and phenibut, respectively, is 30-120 min and 90-180 min. I've actually found that I can feel phenibut even within the 1st hr (it's a drowsy effect that I attribute to GABA-B) but the really nice effects (which I've always attributed to Â±2Â´) can take 4 hrs to fully develop.

As for why phenibut might have altered binding kinetics, and consequently an altered approach to equilibrium, one possibility is the quadrupole of the aromatic ring leading to destabilizing electrostatic interactions in the transition state governing Â±2Â´-phenibut complex formation. Increasing the activation energy of this transition state will reduce the Kon and Koff, which in turn will reduce the rate of equilibration. Phenibut is also slightly larger than gabapentin, which would slightly reduce diffusional access to the binding site, but probably not enough to create a significant kinetic difference.","DrugNerds",46,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/svuwyg/phenibuts_effects_are_often_attributed_to_its_its/"

I decided I'll take 7 pills of pregabalin with me and go to the junkies place, I found a guy who was going to buy crack and H. I tell him if he wanna trade some heroin with pregabalin and he's like ""don't worry we'll sort it out follow me I'm going to buy crack and heroin"" I tell him that I never tried crack and he says ""Imma give you some to try"" Usually when people say that ""follow me"" they will rob you but I had nothing valuable on me so I follow, then a girl appears that was searching for crack as well.

3 of us go to a traphouse, the guy gives me literally like 1g of dope and lets me take 4 crack hits, although it was cheap crack so I didn't really felt anything except a little mood boost and it was the first time I tried crack. (I've done only ritalin and meth). Then the guy refuses to take the pregabalin he just gave me the dope for free. So I'm like I will give that girl the pregabalin because she offered me as well some dope. 

Both of them were really generous and I wish I could stay in touch with them but most of the time I never see someone a second time and I didn't had a phone with me and they were hesitant to give me their number.

They also told me that I'm ruining myself with dope and drugs in general and to stop them now that it's early, they said the only reason they give me is because they know how strong the cravings can be.

Anyway that's the story, also I met a girl there in the traphouse because I mentioned someone who is an asshole and when she heard the name she told me she know him and she gave me her number.

Im currently taking Venlafaxine and Pregabalin, if those are relevant.

Five years later, I have to take 300mg of Pregabalin each day (sometimes need more) for nerve pain in the hand and other medication for my shoulder. When it rains or gets cold, my hand becomes so stiff its unbearable and controls all my concentration. 

I cant live in the moment when Im in pain, cant tell myself there are days when Ill get better, cant do much besides move my fingers and try to rub cream on my hands. I often wish the bastard who hit me killed me, and also that he dies of the same brain cancer that killed my mom four years post-crash.

I gained a lot of weight on the medication, and still find it harder to exercise. The shoulder is weak and AVN means multiple surgeries/prosthetics are likely. 

But the nerve pain in my hand is what kills me. My hand feels stiff to some degree all the time, even during intimate moments. So Im always reminded of my crash. A general physician said with surgery and time (I am having carpal tunnel surgery), I can put this in the past. I laughed in the guys face.

After many years without therapy, I started going again with a new therapist in the town I live now and it's been almost 3 years, so she knows me well. I avoided talking about autism all this time because I was tired of being quickly dismissed and not taken seriously on the subject.

Around 1 year ago my therapist told me I should also see a psychiatrist, because I was having trouble organizing my routine after several attempts. Please note that I see the therapist once a week and the doctor once a month. At the moment the doctor prescribed me sertralin, bupropion, Ritalin, quetiapine (for sleeping) and pregabalin, all mostly for anxiety and depression. I started taking Ritalin because she strongly suspected I had ADHD, which my husband and sister disagreed (both know me very well and think I have autistic traits). 

So, yesterday, the doctor finally started to suspect the diagnosis (I hadn't mentioned a word about autism) and I finally felt free to talk about it and she recommended I take some cognitive tests with a neuropsychologist. Some hours later I told everything to my therapist and even showed her the written recommendation from the doctor. She strongly disagreed with the doctor and even seemed upset about it. She said that because of the Internet people think they have every kind of disorder and asked me if I really thought these tests would help me with anything. In terms of eye contact, she said that this is because I'm shy and that I cared too much about my family and was loving to them (meaning a person on the spectrum wouldn't be able to).

The therapist is in her 50s and it's specialized in psychoanalysis, the doctor is in her 30s and got her degree from a great university. I'm upset with the disagreements and very confused about myself.

Edit: this confusion is mainly because I like my therapist much more. I didn't like the doctor at first because she was very fast, prescribed a lot of meds and I couldn't talk much.

First:

It happened on late January of this year, I was probably on 3-9mg bromazolam and decided to sell my EVGA 1070 FTW which turned out to be a good move because 1)I sold it for a slightly bigger price from what I've paid for it 3.5 years ago because of the ridiculously high prices of graphics cards until recently and 2)prices of GPUs have dropped since that time so it was the best time. What's funny though is that like a week after I sold it, I was probably on bromazolam again and I remember myself looking for the card's box because I used to hide drugs inside it sometimes, a day passed and then remembered that I've sold my card and of course I've given the box as well lol.

I was for a few days in my village where my grandparents live with my father and one night I went outside with my father for some beers and at the same time I've taken 600mg pregabalin, 60mg generic diazepam and I think 375mg tramadol, ended up falling asleep in my chair with my huge ice bong in front of me and the lights opened on 4am and my father randomly walked in because he saw that the lights were on. Found me asleep of course, woke me up, took this huge ice bong I had and one medium bong and one small I had as well and took them to break them and bury them somewhere outside, I remember we argued that night but remember nothing about what happened after that fight and even the next couple days.

"501","2022-07-31",1659239254,"Jordan Monaghan","This is a case that I find interesting, but I wasn't able to find any discussion of it on this sub. Although arguably not a 'classical' serial killer because his crimes were not sexually or compulsively motivated, I think Jordan Monaghan is a rare example of a modern serial killer in an age when advances in policing and forensic science have nearly driven them extinct.

I have based this writeup pretty heavily on the facts as given in a recent Court of Appeal judgement ([link](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2022/1063.html)), fleshed out with information from the media, police and CPS. Unlike the 'canonical' serial killers of the 70s and 80s, there is a not a huge amount of biographical information available, so this will focus more on his crimes than on his background.

Jordan Monaghan was born in July 1991, making him 21 at the time of his first known murder and 31 at time of writing. He lived in Blackburn, Lancashire in northern England during his crimes.

He had three children with a woman named Laura Gray, who was born in November 1992. The two met when they were teenagers. Their first child, Logan, was born on 17 November 2011, when Monaghan was 20 and Gray was either 18 or had just turned 19.

Monaghan was a persistent gambler and financially irresponsible, as a result of which bills went unpaid. In September 2012, Gray (then pregnant with their second child), told Monaghan she wanted to leave him. That same day, Monaghan phoned her to tell her that Logan had swallowed some paracetomol tablets. He was taken to hospital and was fine, although the episode apparently reconciled the two of them.

This would begin a pattern - thereafter, whenever Gray resolved to leave Monaghan, one of their children would have a medical emergency of some sort, which would always convince her to stay with him.

The couple's second child, Ruby, was born on 8 December 2012. Just under three weeks later, on 28 December, Monaghan was alone with her when he reported she was having difficulty breathing. She was taken to hospital, where she was diagnosied with bronchitis caused by a respiratory infection, and discharged three days later on 31 December.

That night, just before 2 am on new year's day, Gray was woken by Monaghan shouting that Ruby was not breathing. Again, an ambulance was called, but this time she could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead at 2:45 am. She was 24 days old.

A post-mortem examination was carried out, but there was no firm evidence of foul play and so the bronchitis, diagnosed three days earlier, was eventually given as the cause of death.

Just over six months later, in July 2013, Gray again tried to end their relationship. The next day, Monaghan phoned her and claimed that Logan had ""gone all floppy"" in his care. Again, doctors could find no obvious cause and diagnosed a respiratory infection. And again, the episode reconciled the couple.

In August 2013, Gray found that Monaghan had a Â£2000 credit card debt he had not told her about. He had spent the money mostly on gambling. She also saw him withdraw Â£300 cash from a secret bank account. She told him that she wanted to end their relationship.

That afternoon, Monaghan took Logan out to a swimming pool so that Gray could sleep. CCTV showed them entering a changing cubicle, where they remained for 27 minutes, before leaving without doing any swimming. The rain cover of Logan's pushchair had been pulled across so that he could not be seen.

When he returned home, Monaghan told Gray that Logan was sleeping. The two had dinner together, before he left. When Gray, now alone, pulled back the rain cover of Logan's pushcair, she found that he was dead. Again, no obvious cause of death presented itself. A post-mortem examination suggested Logan may have been developing pnuemonia, but this did not seem to explain his sudden death. Deliberate asphyxiation was a possibility, but there was no proof.

Logan was 21 months old. As ever, his sudden death apparently reconciled the couple and Gray remained with Monaghan.

The couple's third child was born in May 2016. Many of the sources I have seen say she cannot be named, although she is named openly in the recent Court of Appeal judgement published on BAILII. As she is under 18 and I have not seen an order lifting the naming restrictions, I will refrain from naming her here. Possibly the name on BAILII is a pseudonym?

At the girl's christening on 18 September, Gray saw Monaghan gambling on a fruit machine. This led to an argument, at the end of which she told him she would leave him.

Just over a week later, on 27 September, Monaghan was alone with their daughter when he shouted to Gray that she was not breathing. An ambulance was called, although by the time it arrived she had recovered. No obvious cause for the apparent respiratory collapse could be found. On 2 October, she suffered another apparent respiratory collapse while alone with Monaghan. She recovered quickly, but spent nine days in hospital while the cause was investigated. No cause could be identified.

Monaghan and Gray separated in October 2016. Gray was given custody of their daughter. By this time, the improbable collection of the sudden deaths and respiratory collapses had been reported to police, who began an investigation. At interview, Monaghan denied smothering or otherwise assaulting his children.

Had he stopped here, I think Monaghan would likely not have been prosecuted and almost certainly not convicted. There was no positive evidence he had assaulted any of his children. The case of Sally Clark ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Clark)) had shown the risks of relying solely on statistics or coincidences in these circumstances.

By May 2018, Monaghan was in a relationship with Evie Adams, who was 23 at the time of her death in October 2019. At some point he threatened Adams' ex-partner and their (i.e. Adams' and her ex-partner's) daughter, as a result of which he was given a 12-month restraining order to stay away from her and, presumably, her ex-partner and daughter. However, he was convicted of breaching it more than once and eventually sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment. The order expired in May 2019.

Adams eventually lost custody of her daughter. In October 2019, while still officially on police bail for the suspected murder of Ruby and Logan (although, like I said above, I think likely to 'get away with it', had he refrained from this sort of offending), Monaghan argued extensively with Adams.

Monaghan was apparently by this point dealing in illegal prescription medication. On 17 October, Adams complained of feeling unwell. Monaghan began giving her tramadol, diazapam - both analgesics - and pregabalin, an anticonvulsant. Adams did not know what drugs Monaghan was giving her, but trusted him. She felt increasingly unwell, which she attributed to a ""stomach flu"". She tried several times to arrange for a medical appointment, but Monaghan took her phone and ignored calls from her GP and from NHS 111.

On 24 October, he gave Adams a large overdose of tramadol and left her alone in the house, taking her laptop and phone. He sent a text message from her phone to his suggesting that she was going to take her own life. At 8 pm her aunt found her dead in bed. She was 23.

Naturally, the police were called, although again there was not strong direct evidence that she had been murdered. In November 2019, Monaghan produced a suicide note, apparently written by Adams, which he said he had found in the back of a picture frame. He was interviewed several times by Lancashire Police, and eventually charged with the three murders (and two attempted murders and two counts of cruelty to a child in relation to his surviving daughter) over a year later, in January 2021.

(I think the inclusion of the child cruelty charges likely shows the CPS were not confident that Monaghan would be convicted of the other charges.)

Monaghan was tried at Preston Crown Court. The Crown claimed that he had asphyxiated Ruby and Logan (and his surviving daughter twice, non-fatally) and deliberately poisoned Adams. He maintained that he had not assaulted any of his children and that Adams had taken her own life. After a 10-week trial, he was convicted of all charges in October 2021. He was sentenced to life imprisonment (the only sentence that can be handed down for murder), with a minimum tariff of 40 years before he will be eligible for parole.

Monaghan had 11 previous convictions for 15 offences (including three breaches of the non-molestation order in relation to Evie Adams).

The Solicitor General subsequently applied under [s 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/36) for the sentence to be reconsidered as unduly lenient. The Crown argued that no minimum tariff should be set (i.e. a whole life order; that Monaghan should never be eligible for release on licence). Although conceding that his crimes did not fall within any of the circumstances outlined in [para 2 of schedule 21 to the Sentencing Act 2020](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/17/schedule/21/paragraph/2) (i.e. the circumstances in which the starting point for determing the minimum tariff for a life sentence will ordinarily be a whole life order), the Crown contended that the particular confluence of aggravating factors in his case mean a whole life order is appropriate.

The Court of Appeal was not persuaded, although agreed that the sentence handed down in the Crown Court was unduly lenient and increased it to life imprisonment with a minimum of 48 years before Monaghan will be eligible for parole. I believe this means he will be 77 years old before he can be released on licence.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking personally, I find this case interesting as, based on his behaviour, Monaghan seems to me to fit pretty solidly within Hare's conception of a psychopath. Psychopaths are often misunderstood as either 'crazy' (from people just confusing the concept with 'psychotic') or thought of as Dexter Morgan-like evil geniuses. I think Monaghan is a good real life example - cold and callous, no doubt narcissistic, but also irresponsible and a victim of his own antisocial behaviour just as others were (although obviously not to the same extreme degree).

If I have to take a piss, it takes me many minutes to relieve myself. 

I have been a casual sink pisser for a long time. 

Then a moment came which made my life a lot easier.

The sink in my toilet is a classic pottery sink. And when I hang my schlong on the pottery, the time the piss starts to flow in a minute. I know that's not optimal but still better than 15 minutes.

So I have become a regular sink pisser by now.

I really don't know the reason for it and I think it won't be solved by a quick Google research. But maybe some urologist sink pissers might have an answer.

"521","2022-04-12",1649756265,"An Unusual Presentation of an Uncommon Drug: A Case Report on Phenibut Overdose","&gt;Case Presentation  
&gt;  
&gt;A 30-year-old male arrived to the Emergency Department (ED) by Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Initial presentation showed significant agitation, confusion, and resistance to care with frequent attempts to get out of the hospital bed. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 with confused speech and was uncooperative with the staff. EMS providers reported that he was found by family and neighbors walking around his residence naked with incoherent speech. ED vitals included a heart rate of 159 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, a blood pressure of 164/89 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  
&gt;  
&gt;The physical examination showed a confused, tachycardic, tachypneic, and diaphoretic patient without signs of external trauma. He exhibited perseverating speech, answering all questions with his first name. His pupils were 3 mm and equally responsive to light. Neurologic examination exhibited normal reflexes and no clonus or focal neurologic deficit. His cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and musculoskeletal examinations were otherwise unremarkable. The patient remained agitated, was unable to cooperate with care, and subsequently required both chemical and physical restraints. Consecutive doses of 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, and 16 mg of intravenous lorazepam within a 15-minute period were administered with minimal effect.

I find it interesting that 16mg lorazepam wasn't enough to calm him down on an apparent downer induced psychosis of sorts? Does anyone have an input on how phenibut causes this despite being a downer? I encountered weird stimulant type feelings from phenbiut, gabapentin and pregabalin too and it's really peculiar how it feels.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines and cannabinoids.

They don't state whether it was THC or another cannabinoid which I personally don't get. When I overdosed on phenibut, baclofen, pregabalin, clonidine and diazepam they tested me for drugs at the hospital and I came out positive specifically for THC or as they say in Romania, ""Marijuana"" LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;His mother was concerned he had ingested phenibut via a package he received through the mail two days prior. She showed the ED providers a 500-mg container labeled as Phenibut with Cyrillic writing, approximately half empty. The case was discussed with the local Poison Control Center and supportive care was recommended.

500 mg container? Has to be an error. Maybe 500G. So he ingested 250G within 3 days? That would explain a lot.

"531","2022-06-25",1656174621,"I lost my PIP/Disability Tribunal","I knew what their answer was before the hearing even concluded. Just this horrible gut feeling. I hate that I was right. This is just evil. Its broken me. I cant work, I NEED this money to survive. I NEED it to buy mobility aids and things to lessen sensory distress.

This hell has went on for an entire year and a half and nothing has came of it. So much emotional and mental torture for absolutely nothing. 

I can challenge the Tribunal and ask for another appeal, I could maybe even raise funds to get a lawyer, but it will probably be many more months. 

I really, really needed that backdated money for mobility aids. I need a new mattress, an adjustable bed frame, underlay in the carpets, a shower seat, railings installed, a toilet with a raised seat where a bidet can be installed. All of this is incredibly expensive, the mattress and bed frame I need alone are Â£2500. I was supposed to receive 6 grand. If I scored any more points in the mobility or daily living category I would have received it. I was literally one point off in both sections. 

They claimed last year in July I wasnt disabled enough to receive this benefit and completely disregarded every piece of evidence dated past July 2021. I wasnt allowed to use any evidence like getting a rheumatologist, getting pregabalin, hydrotherapy, my adhd diagnosis. None of it. 

But they looked through ALL of my medical records and instead of considering the massive amount of evidence in front of them they instead cherry picked extremely benign things and used them against me. Like mentioning one single instance where I said to a doctor that I didnt know and was intimidating me that I did yoga so they would stop recommending it and actually help me or misconstruing something I said in my adhd diagnosis appointment. Both took place well after July 2021 by the way. 

So let me get this straight, Im not allowed to use anything past that date to defend myself but theyre allowed to use instances that happened past that date to use against me? So that evidence doesnt count unless its being used against me? How the FUCK is that fair? That entire session was nothing but 45 minutes of ritual humiliation and bullying. I cant keep doing this. 

They completely ignored me being neurodivergent and any of the symptoms that I have with it and claimed my pain wasnt that bad because I wasnt receiving pain medication or a gabapentinoid last summer. Well I do now but the reason why I wasnt being given them wasnt because my pain wasnt that bad but because of doctors insisted I shouldnt receive addictive street drugs because Im soooo young and should try yoga YouTube videos instead. I only received help when I used the last of my savings to pay for a private rheumatologist who immediately prescribed medication. 

Receiving medication doesnt mean someones fibromyalgia is more valid than someone who doesnt it just means their doctor isnt prejudiced or neglectful. It just means their health board doesnt have massive waiting lists and give fibro patients rheumatologists which by the way my health board does not. How is that my fault? How is me being medically neglected mean Im not disabled exactly?

But try telling that to a panel of decrepit posh people who were baffled that I went to Disney one time they went how did you do that? As if airports and Disney as a major theme park doesnt need to be ADA compliant and have disability accommodations. Dear lord. 

For this entire debacle I have felt like people have been watching me and that any moment of joy and any good day I have instantly invalidates my entire condition. Like yes I can make myself a hot drink sometimes, that doesnt mean I should. That doesnt mean it isnt dangerous. 

This type of stuff makes me really feel like Im faking it. It makes me feel like Im not allowed to do anything. I feel like a naughty child who has been grounded. I feel like my narcissistic parent is abusing me again and using any shred of information I entrust to them with against me. This is traumatic. Its evil that they do this to people. Ive never felt so violated and humiliated.","Fibromyalgia",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/vkiqj3/i_lost_my_pipdisability_tribunal/"

He agreed with the rheumatologist I saw last year that I have fibromyalgia but has concerns because I have many characteristics of CFS. He said he doesnt feel comfortable diagnosing me with CFS at this point but hes definitely going to keep an eye on things.

We talked about my previous not so good experiences with drugs that are supposed to help and had the discussion about how it can take years to find the right combination of medication/therapies. I agreed to try other medications so he prescribed Pregabalin and the generic of Flexeril for the absolutely horrendous muscle spasms I have. I dont know that either of those medications will make a difference but Im willing to try.

Some years ago I tried Lyrica for a different situation and it worked for exactly 2 weeks then stopped. He seemed really surprised by that but its in my records and he read it. He just kind of shook his head and asked if the prescribing physician increased the dosage and I said no. That puzzled him and he explained that if it happens again hell slowly increase the dosage until we, hopefully, find one that works.

Of course, we had the talk about the importance of sleep. He hopes the muscle relaxer and Pregabalin combined will help with that but said if they dont, hell work to find something else.


He didnt scold me at all about my weight. In fact, he never mentioned it. I brought it up and he kind of glossed over it, saying that yes being overweight makes things harder but its his opinion that right now thats not my biggest issue. Wow, thats a change of pace! I get so sick of hearing, if you would just lose weight&

He did encourage exercise but was very firm about a couple of things. One is that he doesnt expect me to run a marathon anytime soon and to the exercise needs to be very, very gentle. His suggestions were yoga, tai chi, and qi gong. I have some experience with the last one and he was very encouraging about continuing that. He also encouraged me to walk but said not to get out of breath or overexert myself or even stress over it. He feels that right now 10 to 15 minutes of exercise twice a week would be beneficial. 

Of course, he did a boatload of lab work. Most of the results are already in. Hopefully Ill hear from him in the next couple of days.

All in al I think it was a very productive appointment. I really like this doctor and he seems to have an excellent grasp on fibromyalgia and what it means for patients.","Fibromyalgia",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/scd73o/saw_the_new_rheumatologist_yesterday_and/"

"631","2022-04-14",1649935862,"My experience with pregabalin","I firs tried Pregabalin in July 2021, right after my final exams for my UG ended. At this point of my life I was sober for the past 2 months(exams),but before that I smoked weed quite frequently, done edibles, dropped acid thrice, done DXM multiple times. I stopped smoking the shitty 500rs packet of 10gs you get near my college in bangalore. I only scored some good quality greens but for that I needed money, but didn't have that much at the time. I had read about this drug called Pregabalin, how you trip off it and how readily available it was. 

Tried 300mg (4 tablets ) on my first try. The trip felt great, wasn't strong, wasn't weak, a nice body high and pleasant euphoric feeling. Me being a noob, dismissing my addictive personality and not researching more about this substance I took, lead me down a path of taking almost 450 mg a day. The next week I was doing 600 mg, then 750mg(10 tablets,i.e, 1 whole sheet). The trips were getting less and less potent even though I was constantly increasing the dose as tolerance builds up very fast(which I didn't know back then but I experienced it happen).  Soon enough I was taking more than 750 mg and by mid October I was taking 1500mg. Though this period of me taking 1500mg didn't last  more than a week, I consider myself lucky for not experiencing anything life threatening as I read up on Pregabalin and how dangerous it can be at such high doses, especially when you want to come off the drug. \[I am still not completely sure what the full list of immediate and long term negative effects (both physical and mental)are of taking such high doses, so if anyone does please let me know :) \]. 

The negative effects of me taking Pregabalin everyday stated showing up a week and half after I tried it for the first time. I developed excessive gas and mild bloating, which I naively chalked it up to something I ate at the time. This lasted for the entire time i was consuming Pregabalin tablets. Now at the end of October I had to go out of town for a week on a family trip. That's when the withdrawal symptoms started. Insomnia, restless legs, acidity, heartburn, excessive gas, constipation, depressed mood(worsened by all these fucking symptoms). Safe to say I did not enjoy that trip. After I got back from my week long trip  I immediately took preg and all the symptoms stopped. This showed me that I was addicted and I had to get off this shit.

Since then I slowly reduced my dosage for 1500mg(20 tablets) all the was down to 225 mg(3 tablets) by the end of Feb, with a lot of  inconvenience and suffering along the wasy Tapering it down slowly was the only option I had otherwise withdrawals would have made me relapse. I reduced 75mg every week(mostly). Now I am happy to say that I have been off Pregabalin for a month now. Lingering issues still persist, my digestive tract problems are still there but much much more manageable, sleep issues are mostly gone. Mostly though the change that needs to happen is mental, which is a struggle i think most people in this sub have experienced in one way or the other. Shout out to all my homies out there trying to quit shit and get their life back on track, I'm with you. Though my problem wasn't as major as some of the shit people are going through right now, I wanted to share my story, since not many people talk about this drug.","IndianEnts",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianEnts/comments/u3fcr0/my_experience_with_pregabalin/"

# Stuck in the Middle of Neurotic and Psychotic

&gt;*To my friends and family on the outside at the time, everything seemed normal. I was bubbly and appeared to be in a good mood, but I became very good at hiding my emotions and I learned how to manipulate certain situations and people. For those who dont know, one symptom of BPD is intense emotions and unstable/rapid emotional shifts that happen from moment to moment at a time. I was never taught how to cope with strong emotions, so I began cutting myself at around the age of 13. I became very good at hiding my inner turmoil from everyone. *

Our story begins in a dimly lit room; a young woman lays uncomfortably on a leather sofa while an old man with wiry white hair scribbles on his notepad. She has just explained her childhood and the man has hummed and murmured under his breath the entire time. She lays still, uncomfortably waiting for the next line of berating questions that delve into each part of her psyche and being. The psychiatrist underlines a word twice at the bottom of the page and flips the pad closed. I'm sorry Madam, but your diagnosis is unclear. You are on the border of one or another diagnosis. Your mind is incredibly unclear. I cannot help you. She leaves, feeling more helpless than before.

Depression was first cataloged in the early 1600s (although you could claim the Greeks did it first), obsessive compulsive disorder was characterized in 1834, and schizophrenia by the end of the 1800s. Borderline personality disorder still sat uncharacterized. 
   * Up till the 20th century, most psychiatrists and physicians believed mental illness to be organic in naturethey were caused by the deterioration of a part of the brain resulting in a psychological change. It was Freud who popularized psychoanalysis and the belief that mental health might be psychological in nature first. As such, patients fell into two categories: **neurotic** or able to be analyzed and **psychotic** unable to be analyzed.

* Adolph Stern, a Hungarian-American psychiatrist was enraptured by the ideas set forth by Freud. In 1915 he became a member of the American Psychoanalytic Association and by 1920 was psychoanalyzed by Freud himself. With Freuds health deteriorating by the beginning of WW2, it was Stern and other notable psychiatrists that picked up the psychoanalysis torch. 
   * Now as a bit of an aside, there is a tendency to believe that psychoanalysis was creepy, weird, and overall a pseudoscience. While Freud may have been, psychoanalysis was the gateway needed to open up psychology to a more scientific and *less* superstitious practice. Through Carl Jung and Erik Erikson, psychoanalysis transformed into its modern counterpart cognitive-behavioral theory which was expanded over the course of the late 20th century. I wish I could go through each detail but unfortunately I am entirely underqualified (psychologists hit me up!). 
* Practicing out of New York, Stern was diligent at looking at old pathologies in the new view of psychoanalysis. When speaking to the New York Psychoanalytic Society in 1927, Stern characterized a group of patients who fit frankly neither into the psychotic (non-analyzable) nor into the psychoneurotic group (analyzable) and coined the term **borderline**.

So what is this mystery disease? Borderline personality disorder is part of Cluster B personality disorders. This cluster is dubbed the antisocial personality cluster and is characterized by behavioral traits that are generally outside of cultural norms. BPD can present in many different ways, but is generally identified by a few distinct symptoms:

* Impulsivity (e.g. risky behaviors, substance abuse, promiscuity)
* Suicidaility (about 70% of BPD patients attempt suicide, 10% complete it)
* Heightened affectivity (increased response to emotions like happiness, stress, sadness, etc.)
* Anger
* Brief psychotic episodes (disconnect from reality with or without delusions)
* Intolerable aloneness often culminating in fears of abandonment
* Close relationships marked by idealization or devaluation.

&gt;*Just before being diagnosed with BPD, I was hospitalized. My mother found out I was cutting myself and she forced me to show her where I had been self harming (at this point I was doing it on my thighs to be more secretive) and she immediately took me to the ER. I was admitted to the psychiatric ward and put on Zoloft \[Sertraline\], a few months later I was diagnosed with BPD by an outpatient psychiatrist and put on Lamictal \[Lamotrigine\]. I was told to make sure I was in therapy but he never specified the type- so I just went to a standard CBT therapist. For those who dont know, Dialectical behavioral therapy is the gold standard for borderline personality disorder but the psychiatrist did not specify that. I wish I was in DBT at this time.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Moving forward, I wasn't feeling better. I was still throwing up everything I ate (which my parents didnt know about until later on- I was very good at hiding all of it). I was taking medication, going to weekly therapy, but I just didnt feel better. I began to smoke a lot of weed to cope, along with cutting myself, throwing up whatever I ate, binge drinking, and it just got worse. Not to mention, both of my siblings and both of my parents are addicts.*

Otto Kernberg b. 9/10/1928

Adolph Stern pulled back the curtains on BPD but didnt ascribe to it being a distinct condition in itself. Almost three decades after Sterns talk introducing borderline into the psychiatric lexicon, Otto Kernnberg took a swing at defining the untreatable patients. Kernberg made waves in the psychiatry world with his theory on ego psychologychanging it from a Freudian model to a more modern perspective. He used psychoanalytic psychotherapy to focus on listening to the patient and using their words to modify the treatment. In a sense, he listened first, listened some more, and then made a decision. 

* In 1967 Kernberg released a paper defining the boundaries between neurotic and psychotic patients and firmly defined the criteria that established borderline personality organization. He used Sterns cluster of symptoms and behavioral traits to develop the beginnings of a diagnosis. 
   * This work was expanded by Roy Grinker the following year with the release of a case series on a few BPD patients. This long term study of a few patients integrated the idea that BPD often **overlaps** with other conditions, not excludes them. We now identify other comorbid conditions associated with BPD like eating disorders, self-harm, and substance use disorders. In fact, the extent of comorbidity is so great, that having a patient with *pure* BPD is almost unheard of. 

&gt;*In January of 2016 when my parents divorced (I was about 17-18 at the time), I found a primary care physician who was oblivious. She prescribed me everything I wanted- I didnt/dont have an abuse problem with z-drugs/benzos, but I LOVED adderall. I manipulated her into prescribing it for me. I faked an ADHD diagnosis. Every month I asked her to increase the dose. I ended up on the maximum dose. It may seem stupid to have an adderall prescription and use crystal meth at the same time, but I dont care. There was just something about adderall. I dont know how my doctor didnt see the warning signs. I was rapidly losing more and more weight. I was skeletal at this point.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*I complained about anxiety, so she put me on ativan. I genuinely knew nothing about benzos. I didnt care. I was in a very bad place at the time. I decided to ask her to keep me on adderall 60mg per day (which was gone in days, every month felt like Christmas morning when I got it filled. When I ran out Id use meth or just buy adderall from a girl I knew), klonopin 2mg 2x per day (did not abuse it- it just countered the anxiety and panic attacks from the speed), and lamotrigine which didn't do anything anyways.*

&amp;#x200B;

* In Kernbergs paper, he famously defined BPD as a good-mother bad-mother dichotomy first experienced in infancy that resulted in a split, tearing the world in two. As a result, Kernberg viewed BPD patients as a matter of extremes: Hero and Villain, savior and persecutor, victim and torturer. A relationship of chaos as well as cognitive, emotional, and behavioral instability. Geez Otto, keep it light. 
   * Despite providing little actual evidence in his paper, Kernberg banged on the psychoanalysis drum the loudest. His ideas were repeated constantly and would remain influential in the understanding of BPD. Since the disorder is more common in women, Kernberg pitched the idea that this was a gendered disease reviving the Victorian practice of female hysteria. 

&gt;*Over the next few years, EVERYTHING got worse- not just with my own mental health, but my family life. I was hospitalized again after a really bad explosive argument with my family- I tried to impulsively down my bottle of lamotrigine and 911 was called. The hospital was useless. My eating disorder got so bad that I had a grand mal seizure in the middle of my high school class room. I began to use methamphetamines/adderall(amphetamine salts) to lose even more weight. I stopped taking my medication. My therapist moved, so I stopped seeing a therapist. My parents divorced in January of 2016 and when I thought I had already reached rock bottom, well, I found out rock bottom had a basement. I won't go into all of the details of that year, but it was a very, very, very dark year for me and my family.*

# Okay we lied, mental health is actually biological in nature

&gt;*Fall of 2016. I was depressed, severely suicidal, addicted to speed, dependent on benzodiazepines, unstable, and I was literally dying from an eating disorder. I saw a therapist for a few months and she went to a seminar and she found an eating disorder program in my state that will take my insurance. That therapist/admissions persons/insurance agent who fought for me to be admitted SAVED my life. Honestly, I did not want to go to treatment. I wanted my ED and drugs to kill me. But I needed to leave the abusive environment that I was in. I had nowhere else to go, so I went to rehab 9 hours away.*

With the success of psychoanalysis during and after WW2 (especially when treating PTSD associated with the war), you would be hard pressed to find a single psychiatrist who didnt believe in the merits of psychoanalysis. After all, we saw the greatest works of Carl Jung on personality (which later gave rise to the Myers-Briggs personality test), Hermann Rorschach (the psychiatrist not the DC supervillain), and Erik Erikson (who defined the extremely [famous theory](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/eriksons-theory-of-development/) of life stages and development). The 1950s and 60s was full of introspection (and LSD), so investigating the mind was extremely groovy. Well, until the 70s  came knocking.

* It was Stern that first defined the criteria for borderline personality disorder but he mischaracterized it as a catchall term for those who couldnt fit into other established disorders. To Stern, these patients sat on the border of truly sick and healthy and most patients were thought of as atypical presentations of anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophrenia. This foundation of untreatable would persist for decades impacting treatment of those who needed it most. 

&gt;*Finding a new psychiatric practitioner was tricky. I have been turned away from others, but I kept looking on Psychology Today. I called several, and off the bat I just ask Hi, do you guys treat borderline personality disorder? If not, move on to the next. Some practitioners just refuse to treat personality disorders- my guess is the stigma, and people with personality disorders are (hate to say it but it's true) difficult to treat.*

* The medical community was turned on its head in the 1950s with the discovery of receptors that bound to common neurotransmitters in the brain. Likewise the development of antidepressants and discovery of antidepressants that target those specific neurotransmitters revolutionized the idea of mental health. Again.
   * By the beginning of the 1970s, the world was embracing the race to discover the biologic basis of the brain. The invention of CT scanning changed the game completely as doctors could *see* the brain working while the patient was *alive and without their skull removed*. 

&amp;#x200B;

[John Gunderson 1948-2019](https://preview.redd.it/cgpk3qtb54x81.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c2b1f5e17e5761c00c09994e502cf10cc9e39e)

* This new perspective of BPD as biological changed the inciting factor of BPD from Freudian in nature to a more modern concept. Now seen as a result of one's upbringing or trauma (nurture) or genetics (nature), psychology was changing its view on many of the most solidified disorders. This change in thinking was pushed firmly by John Gunderson throughout the early 1970s culminating in ground breaking BPD research in 1975. It is Gundersons data that was integrated into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980 as part of the third edition. \[If you are interested in learning from Gunderson, he has a [great series on youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_L7KEOxOeQ-fgpNYcWPPiXEHWlXkcyN4) about BPD.\]
   * Since Gundersons paper, a number of different subsequent studies have been done to further characterize the biological nature of the untreatable disease:
      * Twin studies suggest that the heritability factor for BPD is 0.69suggesting that if one twin is diagnosed with BPD, the other twin has a \~70% chance to *also* be diagnosed. This suggests a strong inheritable genetic factor to BPD, especially the impulsive aggression and mood dysregulation symptoms. It should be noted that the chance to develop BPD if a first order relative has BPD (father, mother, non-twin sibling) is around 23-30% while the chance to develop it without a familial history is around 10%. 
      * Psychosocial factors of BPD also play a major role in the development and progression of the disease. A history of substance misuse in the family home can precipitate BPD in susceptible individuals. Likewise, childhood sources of trauma such as neglect or physical/sexual/emotional abuse can all occur in high rates among those diagnosed with BPD. Few studies however point to how the features of the environment specifically create a vulnerability to BPD. For right now we can only classify connections, not causes. 

&gt;*The talk I had with my prescriber was not easy. I needed her to fill out paperwork/recommendation for insurance basically saying I medically need this treatment. needed to be honest with the doctor prescribing adderall. I told her: look.. I have an eating disorder, I have been abusing the adderall this whole time. Can you please fill out the paperwork required so I can get help?. She was not happy at all, but she did it. Looking back, I am one brave motherfucker.*

# Treating the (formally) Untreatable

&gt;*While I was in rehab, the psychiatrist said something that threw me off. He said: You dont abuse people. You dont manipulate people. You behave, so you dont have borderline personality disorder. You have bipolar disorder. I'm gonna start you on seroquel (Quetiapine).. I didnt know what the hell seroquel was. This was my first ever antipsychotic medication, and from this point on, a series of medications were tried over the course of the next 5 years. While I was in the facility, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder with mixed features, generalized anxiety, and ADHD (a serious ADHD diagnosis? Who knew?) And obviously my eating disorder: Anorexia Nervosa purging type.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Since then, I have tried different medications. Several antipsychotics, I experienced this lovely side effect called: akathisia. For me, akathisia was this severe sense of restlessness that I could not control. I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I could not physically stop moving, I couldnt stop pacing. I would walk back and forth for hours. I experienced akathisia on low doses of Geodon (Ziprasidone) and Vraylar (Cariprazine). Low dose Latuda (Lurasidone) was activating and I didnt like how I felt on it. Rexulti (Brexipiprazole) actually helped my depressive symptoms but stopped working for a year and caused me to gain 40 pounds with no change in appetite or activity. I can go on and on, I have tried about 20+ medications to help manage my conditions. They all just didnt work and I got really bad side effects. But dont let my experience scare you.*

Alright, chemistry time! When we look at treating the so-called serious mental illnesses like BPD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, the path is not as clear. Often the answer is not where to begin but will it work? For patients, the road to finding a drug therapy that works for them is a myriad of trial and error, and feelings of failure are rampant among this population. **Sometimes it can take up to a dozen medications before finding the one that solves the issue, thats not the fault of the patient but an example of how each brain is different.** Generally, about 10% of BPD patients will be prescribed an antipsychotic, 27% a mood stabilizer, 35% an anxiolytic, and 61% an antidepressant. Often the prescribed drug is continued in an attempt to prevent stress-related symptoms but if there is, another drug class is added. About 75% of BPD patients are polypharmacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Mood stabilizers are a group of drugs that are used to treat symptoms of mania or depression and bring calmness to the brain. This is a pharmacological class of drugs, not a chemical class as they are made up drugs from anticonvulsants (such as for [epilepsy, oh look another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrganicChemistry/comments/t4m9e1/12_min_structureactivity_relationship_a_look_at/)), antipsychotics, and lithium. As such, the structures of these drugs vary but we do see their relative effects to be similarhence pharmacological not chemical class.

[Iminostillbene vs Carbamazepine vs Oxcarbazepine](https://preview.redd.it/uknfqvho54x81.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6779f923cf64757ee8bd9c9ff3a82f18eb721dce)

* Our first drug is **Carbamazepine** (Tegretol). This antiseizure medication was developed in 1968 as an improvement of Phenytoin, an hydantoin. Carbamazepine needs to be titrated up to its effective anti-seizure dose (800-1600mg) on a slow weekly schedule. This slow weekly increase of 200 mg showed a mood stabilizing effect (lower highs and higher lows) which prompted researchers to investigate its usefulness in mood disorders (like bipolar disorder). They found that lower doses of carbamazepine actually improved mood symptoms and so the extended release of the drug was marketed as a mood stabilizer in 2004. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Metabolism of Carbamazepine and Oxcarbazepine](https://preview.redd.it/uln8rpzq54x81.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2a7fb1565f75ee6a721332ad7b1b918d7d491e)

* **Oxcarbazepine** (Trileptal) is the 10-keto version of carbamazepine. Unlike carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine shows significantly less auto-inducing of its own metabolism, and so a smaller dose of medication can be given. Also, oxcarbazepine levels do not need to be monitored as closely in new patients or those undergoing intense antibiotic regimens. Oxcarbazepine is used off label for bipolar disorder and BPD. 
* Carbamazepine is used for its ability to improve impulsivity and can be extremely useful in younger patients who naturally show more proclivity towards risky behavior. This can be why it is also used in the treatment of substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Unfortunately it can lead to a worsening in depressive symptoms which may result in an increase in suicidal thinking in non-suicidal patients.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Topiramate](https://preview.redd.it/7w3hz3ou54x81.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3406a06f8e6f985ace5ef2d816898dda24ca9793)

* **Topiramate** (Topamax) is among my top 5 drug structures. Any organic chemistry student will have flashbacks to furiously studying hemiacetals, acetals, and sugars. My question for them is: what kind of structure is topiramate? If you said a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide derived from **fructose** then good on you! (easy amirite?) Topiramate was approved in 1996 for partial and tonic-clonic seizures. Later, it was found to be useful in a myriad of behavioral and mood disorders like augmenting alcohol dependence, binge eating disorder, bipolar disorder, bulimia nervosa, and BPD. It is also indicated for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its side effects of loss of appetite and weight loss.
   * Due to sulfamate moiety, topiramate is excreted 80% unchanged by the kidneys. This means that most of the drug is not even processed in the liver, making it a great option for patients with heavy drug therapies or liver dysfunction. This does require good kidney function to be maintained and so older patients who may develop renal insufficiency should be closely. 
   * Topiramate has demonstrated teratogenicity or that it affects fetal development. As such, females of reproductive age are advised to be on oral contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Even though Topiramate does not undergo much liver metabolism, it does affect the livers processing of other drugs. Notably, it affects the Cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Oral contraceptives are metabolized through CYP3A4 making them less effective. As such, patient taking this drug while using oral contraceptives should use a secondary form of backup (like condoms). 
   * Topiramates usefulness comes from its effect on strong emotions like anger, sadness, and anxiety. Patients report an increase in interpersonal relationships though, which helps with integration in social settings which probably is the reported increase in quality of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Lamotrigine](https://preview.redd.it/b3ojfscw54x81.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02c10ae6f66254cc76f6c4d0d8e40f50983b6246)

* Next up on our list is **Lamotrigine** (Lamictal) is a 5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazine derivative originally indicated for adult partial seizures and adjunctly to patients with a rare form seizure disorder called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Uniquely, Lamotrigine requires a very slow up-titration schedule with most dose increases happening once every two weeks. This is done to avoid precipitating a life threatening immune condition called Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). These adverse events are a life-threatening skin rash that can cause large portions of the skin to become ulcerated. That being said, lamotrigine is a safe medication that when used correctly can be life saver for many patients. 
   * Lamotrigine combines the benefits of Topiramate and Carbamazepine. It has a benefit on strong emotions like anxiety and anger while also improving impulsivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*I eventually found a psychiatric nurse practitioner who specifically said they treat trauma and personality disorder, along with mood and anxiety disorders. She is now my current prescriber and she is amazing. We found a medication combination that works wonders: Lithium Carbonate and Pregabalin (Lyrica). I'm also on other as needed medications: Hydroxyzine, Clonidine: both PRN for anxiety/sleep. She is also the only doctor who is willing to do the Ashton Manual: Because Ive had issues tapering off of Klonopin itself, we are currently cross tapering from Klonopin (clonazepam) to valium (diazepam), and will eventually taper off. Besides occasional cannabis use, I have stayed clean from everything else.* 

* **Lithium** carbonate (Eskalith, Lithobid) is a unique drug because it is actually not a drug! Well& not in the traditional sense. Lithium is an **ion**, not a organic chemical like most other drugs. We think that Lithium works by reducing neuron excitability and increasing inhibitory neuronal processes, thus stabilizing brain activity. Likewise, as an ion similar to sodium, it regularly enters the cell and affects intracellular secondary messaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Therapeutic Index vs Lithium Toxicity Symptoms](https://preview.redd.it/n2opxcz064x81.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67291fed18fea03c15270bd2847b735d15ff6fde)

* Lithium is titrated to a certain blood level of 0.6-1.2 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). This range is called the therapeutic index/window or the blood concentration range needed to show the desired effect. In this case, lithium improves emotional instability and brings a person back to normal quicker than without it. Below the range, patients see a sub-therapeutic effectin this case the return of the BPD symptoms. Above the therapeutic range, the person would see lithium toxicity. It should be noted that a person can see chronic toxicity or side effects even at therapeutic levels. 
* As an ion, Lithium is not metabolized by the liver at all like other drugs. Instead, it is completely handled by the kidneys. As such, ensuring kidney function is key for preventing acute lithium toxicity. As such, patients who show rapid renal decompensation could present seizures, heart attacks, delirium, coma, or death. Lithium is thus considered a narrow therapeutic index drug since the range is very small and the potential effects are so dangerous. 

&gt;*Lithium has been the main game changer. My level ranges between 0.2-0.3, so its sub-therapeutic and my doctor has seen this in practice. The typical effective range is 0.5-0.8, but this low level has made a significant difference in my emotional lability, rage outbursts, depressive symptoms, and some of my emotional reactivity. I feel like I can actually utilize the skills Im supposed to use. Side note: Not saying medication is a cure, but my medication regimen has made a HUGE difference compared to before taking it.*

&amp;#x200B;

# The gold standard is NOT drug therapy

When discussing mental health, treatment should not be a discussion of drugs *or* therapy. Studies have shown therapy alone to be *superior* to medications alone and a synergistic effect when the two are combined in an intentional way. As such, drugs and therapy are instances where 1 + 1 = 5. 

&gt;*When I was hospitalized for my 4th time, the psychiatric practitioner told me I was bipolar and that I was having a mixed episode, but I was told by a weekend doctor (during the weekends there's a different psychiatric nurse practitioner than during the week) and he went over my symptoms and told me you dont have bipolar disorder. You have borderline personality disorder. You really need DBT. I knew it. It always confused me because when you read literature on bipolar, episodes of mania last for several days at a time- I didnt have that. My moods/emotions are highly changeable and can be extremely reactive, but they never last for several days in a row. I meet the full diagnostic criteria for BPD- every single symptom.*   
*While I was in treatment, my family moved across the country. So when I completed treatment, I didnt return back to my hometown. I didnt have the connections I did to get drugs. Anytime I would bring up misdiagnosis, they would blow me off so I felt kind of hopeless. I didnt know how to find DBT. DBT is not readily available in my area.*

* For many the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is key for understanding how our thoughts and emotions dictate our behaviors and vice versa. CBT gives individuals the ability to recognize maladaptive thoughts and gives them tools for better thought patterns, perceptions, and behavioral goals. 
* For personality disorders like BPD, cognitive behavioral therapy is not the best approach. These individuals struggle to regulate the emotion *before* it generates into a thought (hence the high prevalence of impulsivity). As such, these individuals benefit from a more specific kind of CBT, called **Dialectical Behavior Therapy** (DBT). 
   * DBT relies on using mindfulness skills to help regulate emotions, tolerate distress, and improve relationships. DBT helps teach individuals how to live *with* discomfort and accept the way things are rather than reacting to the discomfort in unhelpful ways. 

&gt;*I moved to a nearby city, and because of the clinics policy they don't treat people in the county Im living in. Damn. Im scared. Ive tried a benzo taper before, who is willing to keep me on it? How do I find a good therapist? What should I do? I called at least 10 places. Most either didnt get back to me, didnt accept BPD patients for whatever reason even though its on their profile, OR they don't take my insurance. I left a message for one who takes my insurance. I was just done. I was ready to give up.*

* The origin of DBT is incredibly interesting. In 1950, a 17 year old girl was locked in a seclusion room at the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. She was admitted for being suicidal and formally diagnosed with schizophrenia. Early treatment notes labeled her the most disturbed patient on the ward and was subjected to electroconvulsive therapy. One year later, Linehan left the Institute of Living and attended Loyola University, Chicago in 1968. She would graduate cum laude with a BS in psychology, an MA in 1970, and finally her PhD in 1971 after studying social and experimental personality psychology. She is diagnosed with BPD. 
   * Through her work, Linehan developed two important concepts related to personality disorders. Taking inspiration from Eastern meditation and zen, she described how people must learn to accept the way the world is to achieve a meaningful and happy life as well as how change is needed for growth and happiness. She culminated these teachings in dialectical behavioral therapy and started treating BPD, eating disorders, and substance abuse disorders with DBT.

* Linehan faced immense pushback from the psychiatric communitywhen she debuted DBT in 1991, behaviorism was on the rise. She used her research on suicide and sociological phenomena to dismantle Kernberg and his theories that were developed with little evidence. Her DBT model showed higher rates of recovery than using traditional CBT and patients felt validated and empowered. 
* Linehan was awarded the Career Achievement Award from the American Psychological Association in 2005 and The Outstanding Educator Award from the New England Educational institute in 2004.

&gt;*About a week later in November or so, I got a call back from the last person I called and left a message for. She takes my insurance, specializes in BPD, and is accepting patients. Weekly appointments, it was perfect. I am not exaggerating when I say this therapist was the most thorough therapist I have ever seen. She wanted every detail about my childhood, my symptoms, and just everything about me. It was a very intricate process. I told her about my previous bipolar diagnosis and she pulled out her handy DSM-5 (I think its hilarious when professionals just whip a DSM out) and went over the criteria for bipolar disorder. She ruled out bipolar because of my exact reasoning: My episodes DO NOT last for days and days and days, like a bipolar person would. She diagnosed me with everything at the beginning of this short novel. She is my current therapist and I am currently learning DBT.*

# Always advocate for yourself and what you believe in

&gt;""For anyone reading going through anything similar to my story, theres a few things I would like to share. Some things that I wish I knew back when I was 14.   
&gt;  
&gt;First, psychiatric medication is serious business. Its not something to be scared of IF its prescribed for the right reasons. ALWAYS DO YOUR RESEARCH. Do not let 1 side effect scare you, but its good to be educated on what you are putting in your body, what you may experience as a result (side effect), hell, now when Im prescribed something I spend hours researching the medication. Reviews from drugs.com. Reddit experiences. But again, if youre prescribed an antidepressant for example, and you read 1 horror story, dont let that deter you from taking it. Dont let MY experience with the meds I stated earlier scare you. Some have wonderful success with Geodon for example, and thats great! It just was not for me. I will say, Its almost never recommended to take benzodiazepines long term. Strictly as needed is okay, but even then there's better alternatives for panic attacks, like clonidine (in my opinion). \[Side note: When you google something for research, pull information from websites that end in .org, .gov, .edu, or from verified organizations such as WebMD, MayoClinic, NAMI, etc.\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, they always say listen to your doctor- which is true- but if something sounds off, or even if you just want a second opinion, I recommend getting a consult from another physician just to see what they say, OR do your research on what they say. For example, when that psychiatrist in the rehab center said You dont abuse people. You dont manipulate people. You behave, so you dont have borderline personality disorder. You have bipolar disorder. I'm gonna start you on seroquel. I should have said something. I didnt know what I know now about BPD. ALWAYS ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. Plenty of doctors refuse to diagnose personality disorders, and would rather diagnose bipolar and prescribe an expensive brand name antipsychotic so they can have some kickback from the pharmaceutical industries. I have experienced this, being on all of these expensive brand name antipsychotics and it's disgusting. If it works, great!! Bottom line: Do your research. Just because someone with an expensive piece of paper is telling you something does not mean you have to listen to it OR that its true.   
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this reaches someone in time of need and helps in some way. My inbox is always open for any questions or just someone to talk to :)""

"661","2022-02-11",1644620050,"Painkillers","My Dr refuses to prescribe me any painkiller medication. I have amitriptyline but only for night and that's it.  He's of the belief that no painkiller will do anything since the issue isn't really pain but the nerve receptors in the brain or something.  He also refuses to refer to specialists or whatever so I'm at the end of my tether here.  Any ideas?  Or even just words of encouragement at this point =

Edit: thank you so much for all the replies.  

However, i need to clarify a few things - I have definitely tried all the other doctors available at my gp surgery.  They are worse.  

I take duloxetine twice daily, amitriptyline at night, pregabalin daily (or something, however it's spelt.  For migraines).  I take paracetamol, ibuprofen and occasionally 8/500mg cocodamol from my local pharmacy.  This is maybe once a week because i like the fact that it does something. A teeny tiny miniscule something but something.  On those days, i am stuck in bed.  

I am definitely luckier than some of you in that my pain is only debilitating and limiting maybe once a week.  And I only get bad flairs every couple months. But I have been dealing with chronic pain since I was 14 (2014) so maybe I'm a little desensitized to it since I just never took painkillers at all until about two years ago.  

I am going to look into places that might accept self referrals and also push my doctor more.  I definitely feel more validated and confident in myself after all your support and advice.  Thank you.  It's kinda made me tear up a lil just to know I'm not alone d","Fibromyalgia",112,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/sqc211/painkillers/"
"671","2022-09-18",1663505614,"2 years later, I feel much much better now. Here's what I did.","I'm not cured yet, I still feel pain every day, specially after ejaculating, but it's so much better. I can have a mostly normal life now, I don't think about CPPS most of the time, I just go about my business and I'm confident the remaining pain will also subside with time. I'd say I'm about 80% better. I got a message in private from a member of this community asking me what I did to get better, and since it turned into a write up, I thought I should share it here with everyone as well:

-Try different meds: what worked best for me was amitriptyline and tadalafil. I'd say tadalafil saved my life, my post ejaculation pain decreased dramatically after I started taking it, and that's what gave me a glimpse of my sex life back and allowed me to be hopeful for the future. Amitriptyline helps with general daily pain a lot. I took it for more than a year and dropped it a few months ago because I was gaining too much weight on it. It was worth it though, it helps. Pregabalin has worked from some people, not for me, but you should try it. People also talk about quercetin and magnesium glycinate, try everything, but do it one by one and give yourself time to be able to tell what works and what doesn't. It's a long process, you can't rush through or you'll end up having 6 pills every day not knowing which ones are helping

-Pelvic Floor PT helps. It's hard to find a good one where I live so it didn't help me that much, but you should def look for one if you can

-Watch the effects of food. I've noticed dairy is a huge trigger for me, and I've been feeling much better since I've cut milk. Vitamin C is another big no-no, as are acidic food in general. I also don't drink coffee nor anything with caffeine. Pay attention to everything you eat and how it affects you, especially inflammatory things like the ones I've mentioned and others like gluten and alcohol.

-Have a healthy routine of enough sleep and exercising. Light exercising is great. If you go to the gym, DO NOT do any exercises from the bellybutton below. No abs, no legs, no glutes until you've beat this. Upper muscles are fine but pay attention if you're not straining your abs too much, your abs are closely tied to your CPPS as well. Running is fine, biking or elyptical are NOT.

-Buy a thermo gel bag, it helps immensely because it's the only thing that provides instant relief for me. The worst thing about this condition is that no meds work when you're having a flare up, so it's like your only option is to wait it out. But I've found out that heat is a huge game changer, it can provide instant relief. You can take a sitz bath, but a thermo bag is what worked best for me because it's very practical, just heat it on the microwave whenever you're feeling pain and apply it around your perineum/anus, you will feel the relief immediately. This was huge for me. It seems stupid and unlikely that such a simple thing will help that much but it's true, so DONT SKIP THIS TIP. A thermo bag is super cheap and can change your life.

-Change your mindset. This is the hardest thing to do, but you have to try to be cool with having CPPS. It fucking sucks, it hurts, but it is what it is, and you have to keep going on with your life. The more you think and get anxious about this condition, the worse it gets. As soon as you start being okay with it, it has far less power over you and you will start to feel better gradually. This is hard to do when you're having a lot of pain, that's why you use the other techniques i talked about to decrease the pain level to something bearable, and from there you can work in your brain to just not care. Remember there are a lot of people going through much worse things than this, everyone's got a burden to carry. If this is what ours is, it's not that bad, honestly. There are people in wheelchairs, fighting cancer for years etc, you're not the most unfortunate person in the world and millions would kill to be in your place. Remember that.

-And remember: IT'S TEMPORARY. The worst thing you can do is be worried if this will last your whole life. This mindset is what makes you become desperate and what keeps you from healing. It won't last your entire life. It takes time to get better, and it might not become 100% better, but it WILL get better, and it WILL eventually become something that won't get in the way of doing anything in your life. Be chill about it, do what you must to get better, and go live your life. You will feel much better before you realize it.","Prostatitis",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/xhfwhy/2_years_later_i_feel_much_much_better_now_heres/"
"681","2022-03-11",1646961903,"55 days streak GONE. But atleast i feel.... calm and alive. i miss this habit. idk if i should Try to stop again or continue. i miss selfharm so much","**STRONG** TW; Drug addiction and selfharm  (graphic,)

This post is Very long but I would be happy if someone reads it. Sorry for typos i write this on alcohol, diazepam and amphetamine.

WARNING. This post does not glorify selfharm or addiction. Please don't start. As you see from this post I'm stuck. I can't stop eathier. Please don't do what I'm doing. This is just vent post. 

Why the hell stop. I just love seeing my own inside and blood. I just hate you (me). I hate myself i like seeing myself hurt. I like endorphins. I'm a fucking stupid junkie who deserves the worse. I like morphine, heroin, oxycodone and i LOVE self harm..

All those Drugs i mentioned are expensive. Selfharm is free and provides same relief kinda. Instant calmness. I wish one day to go to s forest, inject myself with strongest opioid and cut my body up. 

Jeeze what the Fuck did i say. How did i get to this point.

I tried staying clean. 55 days without cutting,

But It wasn't healthy .

I replaced cutting with poly drug addiction. opioids then ketamine and IV Heroin for a while, but i got most attached to .... Amphetamine. It was cheap, gets the Job done and stopped sucidal thoughts. However i always accidentally overdose and that's uncomfortable as hell.

I've been trying to lose weight so i can gain muscles later but now on amphetamine i wanna get as skinny as i can while still eating tasty food. I love how the muscle tension from amphetamine makes me look skinner and makes my scar pop. I love touching them. Feels so nice and it calms me down. 

I'm so socially stupid and as if now literary have 0 , yes 0 friends. Cutting is always here for me . Always here. To calm me and help me.

I miss being severely underweight. Now I'm "", average"" and feel bad. I hate how i keep eating like a fat ass. I love food but wanna get skinny.

Thanks to amphetamine, i lost quite a bit if fat and muscles. Now i look skinner. But i want more.

I was never diagnosed but few years ago i was skeleton and through I was fat. Maybe Ed? Who knows. 

As i said i like speed (amphetamine/Adderall). But i always accidentally overdose, get fever and muscle pain. I've lost enough wait that a common/ moderate dose is now way too much.

But today, my Benzos arrived. 150 mg Xanax and 1050 mg valium. (Xanax is alprazolam, valium is diazepam)

I took a lot today. But made one mistake. I snorted a big ass line of amphetamine and some white powder got stuck outside my nose.

My mom later , saw me with a rolled up paper and white powder on my nose 

I love my mom so much. What have I done. I have disappointed her so much. I'm s fucking pathetic addict. She works her ass in me and I'm this ? I deserve to fucking mutilate myself not just cut. I wish to remove my stupid skin off.

She will never trust me again. I said it was caffeine i extracted while ago. She believed it was caffeine but still was mad. I told her "" i told you yesterday to buy me Nasal spray but you didn't, it's not just my fault,"".

I then said I'm so sorry. 

I disappointed her so hard. She used to Trust me. She knows i have lots if Benzos st home. She thought i used them for medical proposes. Like using 2x a week MAX. And taking week breaks. She knows i Know a lot about pharmacology and won't get high.


Not she will suspect me as addict. Wich i am. I'm fucking pathetic .

One time i stayed up 3 days with amphetamine and then Pregabalin. I heard voices telling me I'm pathetic, selfish junkie . They are correct. I know it is just a Hallucination but I'm so pathetic. No friends. I use substances to cope with loneliness I'm selfish. I disappointed my mom so Hard.

But i don't wanna disappoint her .

Today i acted weirdo. I was so nice and empathetic to my mom , sister and dad. In usually asshole when sober .. i walked s but weird. She knew something was up 


She can't find out about my addiction. It's the only thing i look forward in life


But I'm 100%  sure after all This,  she now knows I'm misusing these benzos and will throw them away now .. understandable she doesn't want her son to get high and waste his exams and she wishes best for me . I don't blame her drug abuse is unhealthy, she has good intentions.

But i can't live without this.

I panicked so hard. I tried to tell myself cutting isn't Worth it. It's temporary calmness. But i got so scared of the idea if living without coping mechanism.

I've never stolen. I buy substances with my own money. But as always, addicts and junkies are portrait as evil.

But i felt This is the end . Everything was going fine for weeks. But i fucking forgot to clean my nose 

I really didn't want to do it but I took my blade out.

i just made 2-3 cuts and calmed down. They're small but I've missed this so much . Been so long.

I can't believe she now knows my secret now.

I'm thinking of killing myself it's over. I Told her I'll explain tomorrow but she will now look in my room and throw away my stuff. 

I have fucking old empty morphine box in my room . If she finds it she will probably disown me. 

But amphetamine, opioids and Benzos are only reason I'm alive they are only thing that make sucidal thoughts go away  .

Amphetamine has made me stop selfharm 

I'm not encouraging drug use please never start this. I can't stop anymore I've made it my coping mechanism. 


But cutting.... It just calmed me. Made me forget what happened...

But now i wanna cut more. I wanna forget more. I wish this never happens. I wanna cut my forearm and burn myself 

I wish to hit a artery so bad. I've tried killing myself 5 times in past year. Just please let me die. I'm out if opioids tho can't Kill myself .

Just let me die already.

Idk if she believes it's caffeine. I Hope she does. I don't want her to know I'm using Stims to cope with existence...i opend up so much today... 

I need my Benzos. They make me better human   i become more empathetic, more kind, more understanding 

And i feel normal . When sober i just think about sucide and selfharm. I can't live on like this. I wanna eathier kill myself or have my substances.

Psychologist said i might have level 2 ASD (autism) and I'm having evaluation next week.

This has stressed me out so much. What if i am fucking level 2 retard ? Bit level 1 like Asperger's. Level 2..


It would explain all my stupid and alienated behavior but it means I'm doomed to be lonely.


I was clean for so long because i don't want to be Boyd checked and someone sees my scars.

But while I was on 2 mg Xanax, i told my mom i like pain. i opened up so much to her. I Told her i do burn myself sometimes . 

I love her so much...

But if she knows I'm a fucking pathetic junkie, i would rather die ..

But the only way i cope is cutting myself and getting high. I don't know how to cope with literally 0 friends. This is my only way. I've been cutting since 2020 and addicted to getting high everyday for 2 months .

She said well talk tomorrow. It's 2 am rn. If it goes bad I'm having no option but killing myself.

I literally love cutting as a opioid. It feels similar in the sense it instantly calms you . I find cutting and IV heroin to be the single 2 most addictive habits ever...

I decided back in Feb to go 11 days sober as tolerance break and for blood test. Cold turkey.

I learned something about myself. 

In those 11 days the only thing i thought about was selfharm. I wanted to cut so bad.

I can't believe i cut today. I went  2 months clean atleast. But failed at 55 days .

Fuck it. I already relapsed.

55 DAYS CLEAN FROM CUTTING GONE.

Why not cut more ? I only have one cut on my forearm. I Miss the blood dripping.

I miss it so much.

But gosh. Rip short sleeves and shorts.

I can't believe how much worse my cutting has gotten.

If you're thinking about starting selfharm, please no , it's more addictive then  heroin (IME and statistically)

Please don't cut . I keep telling my sister who also cuts to stop. 

You don't deserve it. Don't cut please it's so addictive 

Here i am, felt back in the cutting addiction..

But for love or god don't start cutting if you're thinking about it ..

I used to do small ""cat scratches"" that went away. Not I have Perma 1.5 inch deep scars FILLED on my tight .


Please stop while you can. It's so addictive

Please don't start this habit. it will never leave you. You might take breaks but it's so addictive.

I'm getting worse by the day lately. Fatigue wasn't a prominent symptom of mine initially, but now it's overwhelming me. Like wading through sand. I struggle taking care of myself, of my young daughter. I neglect my own needs to care for her. I feel fucking depleted.

My spouse works long hours. Nights. Weekends. Holidays. Travels for weeks at a time. I barely survived his last month long work trip. It set me back so much. I don't know how I'll survive the next one.

Is anyone else in this progressively worsening state at two years?

My symptoms:

- Chronic Migraine
- Occipital neuralgia, or something of that nature
- Nerve pain
- Neuropathy 
- Joint pain, joint popping, joint looseness 
- Muscle aches
- Muscle weakness
- Fatigue
- Memory loss/cognitive difficulties 
- Tinnitus
- Double vision and eye fatigue
- Heart palpitations (thudding, flutters, irregular beats)
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Acid reflux

I do not have periods of wellness, though I can occasionally experience relatively good days. Less as time goes by. My pattern has been a steady worsening of symptoms with periodic flares, or new symptoms appearing after exposure to illness (like colds, not covid) or strenuous activity.

I've had an assortment of tests, imaging, bloodwork without real answers as to what's going on in my body.

- Two brain MRIs, spaced a year apart. There were scattered white matter hyperintensities. After a year, there was no change.
- MRI of my spine. Some degeneration, bone spurs. Nothing covid related. 
- MRA of my head and neck to rule out aneurysms. It was all clear.
- MRI of my knee. High, tilted patella, edema of the hoffa's fat pad and insertional quadriceps tendinosis. I suspect several other joints may be in similar condition.
- 24 hour holter monitor was normal.
- EMG and nerve conduction study was normal.

My results of my bloodwork are a mile long. They ruled out common vitamin deficiencies/toxicities, heavy metal toxicity, lyme, I never had inflammatory markers, and had a number of autoimmune diseases ruled out.

Whatever is wrong... whatever particular variety of long covid I ended up with, I just want to be able to slow down this damage.

Edit: 

I forgot a couple tests. In case anyone is curious about these things.

- Hearing test. Perfect. Word recognition was slightly off, but could be a preexisting thing.
- Endoscopy. Normal.
- Glucose fasting. 99.
- H. Pylori. Negative.
- Abdominal ultrasound for right side lower ribcage pain. All clear. 

And, current medications and treatments:

- Botox for migraines. It's working!
- Zomig/zolmatriptan 5mg for migraines, as needed. 
- Cymbalta/duloxetine 90mg for joint pain and nerve pain. It stopped working, and I may eventually taper down.
- Lyrica/pregabalin 200mg for joint pain and nerve pain. Amazingly more helpful for joint pain... at 300mg it made no difference to my nerve pain.
- Topamax/topiramate 25mg for the lightning storm shredding through my face, head, neck, and shoulders. It's taken the edge off.
- Wellbutrin/bupropion 300mg for my sanity. It helps. It's helped my energy level and cognitive issues as well. Only somewhat of course. I'm still nearly bedridden most days.
- Prilosec/omeprazole 40mg for reflux. Helps.
- Pepcid/famotidine 40mg for reflux. Helps... with reflux only. No other benefit.

##Warning

Withdrawal symptoms may not be experienced for up to **72 hours** after going cold turkey or drastically decreasing your dose. Always assume you need to taper after daily use. Experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms may affect your rational judgement.

References
#####Slow taper: decreasing 0-50 mg per day
#####Normal taper: decreasing 50-100 mg per day
#####Fast taper: decreasing 100+ mg per day

Fast tapering should usually be avoided, especially if you experience panic attacks, seizures, severe agitation, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, insomnia, severe lethargy, depression, muscle jerking, tachycardia or hyperthermia.

##Basic Phenibut Withdrawal Information

####If phenibut is unavailable or can't be used what other drugs have been used to combat withdrawal symptoms?

Baclofen, Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) and Benzodiazepines.

**[This is an example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604470/table/BCR2012008381TB1/?report=objectonly)** of how baclofen can be used to taper off of phenibut.

#####What over-the-counter products can help?

L-theanine, Magnesium, Lavender (Silexan), Ashwagandha and Kava pills or tea (kava should not be taken with other herbs). These supplements are only somewhat helpful they shouldn't be a substitute for tapering.

For sleep, benadryl (diphenhydramine) can be helpful.


#####If you go to urgent care / ER it's helpful to bring

Your phenibut container. A container helps doctors know what they're dealing with.

If the doctors are unfamiliar with phenibut you can show them **[This is an example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604470/table/BCR2012008381TB1/?report=objectonly)** of how phenibut withdrawal has been successfully managed.","phenibut",103,"https://www.reddit.com/r/phenibut/comments/ttxaml/quitting_phenibut_support_thread/"
"761","2022-09-18",1663494355,"I have severe fibromyalgia with widespread chronic pain and muscle spasms. All other meds Im on hardly did anything. Low Dose Naltrexone has changed my life, and has finally given me hope after years of suffering.","I started with 1.5mg and slowly worked my way to 4.5mg, going up 0.5mg at a time. Since the very first dose, I noticed a decrease in pain. With every single dose increase, the pain relief got better and better. When I hit 3.5mg, I had ZERO pain the next day during my 8 hours of work. Thats right - after three years of absolute hell, I was able to sit in my chair and type on my computer without back, shoulder, and wrist pain. It just confused me so much because I had forgotten what that was like. It only lasted a day or so, but going up to 4mg had the same effect, and same with 4.5. I havent tried going up any more, but might give it a shot one of these days. I dissolve 50mg tablets into distilled water and measure out my dose each day. 

Before LDN, I was icing my bad knee 4-5 times per day, never leaving the house unless absolutely necessary, couldnt stand up for very long due to my knee and hip pain, and couldnt work more than a few hours per day just sitting at my computer. My pain was a baseline level of 5/10, and went up from there quite often. My partner was massaging me twice per day, often for two hours each time, just to keep me able to hold down my job. My physical therapist was regularly threatening to stop seeing me because I wasnt making any progress and couldnt do hardly anything he asked me to. 

Now, I absolutely NEVER ice my knee, and its fine. Im able to stand and walk for hours and house. Im able to work at my computer as long as I need to. Im able to sleep on my side without severe pain, which is just insane. Im able to let the cats into my bedroom at night, because it no longer causes me extreme pain if a cat lays on me. My partner only massages me once per day for only one hour. Im able to actually do everything my physical therapist tells me to, and Ive been able to use light dumbbells for the first time in years. Oh also chronic fatigue is mostly gone. My pain is a baseline of 0-2, and I actually spend at least an hour or two every day without pain, which is a serious blessing. Im able to go out in public and hang out with friends for hours and hours without issue. I can handle being n the car for at least a few hours, which was NOT the case before. 

I hope Im not speaking prematurely, but I seem to have found my miracle drug. LDN has given me 70-80% of my life back. Im still taking 150mg of pregabalin 3x daily, 5mg baclofen 3-4x daily, 15mg meloxicam once daily, and various OTC supplements. I plan on asking my doctor to try lowering the dosages and/or frequency of all these meds, with the hope that maybe LDN will be enough without quite as much else going on. Well see what he says. 

If youve been considering trying this out, please do yourself a favour and try it. Im well aware it doesnt work quite as well for everyone, unfortunately. By the way, the only side effects Ive noticed are vivid dreams and an increased sex drive, both of which I consider to be good things. Obviously Im not yet where I need to be, since I still rely so heavily on massage, but things are finally starting to look up :)","LowDoseNaltrexone",18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/LowDoseNaltrexone/comments/xhcg7d/i_have_severe_fibromyalgia_with_widespread/"

"781","2022-07-12",1657624983,"PREGABLIN IS NOT A GABA AGONIST","I see many people commenting that Pregablin should be avoided as it targets the GABA receptors. This is completely false, and has been shown to reduce benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms and a fantastic aid during tapering. Pregabalin does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB, or benzodiazepine receptors. Instead, it binds the alpha2-delta subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. Basically Pregablin reduces glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is the fight or flight response and causes symptoms of anxiety, seizures, delirium, psychosis. 

When you take any GABA agonist, it converts to Glutamate which is essentially the opposite of the calm relaxation feeling. 

Pregablin has also been shown to eliminate Excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity is a phenomenon that describes the toxic actions of excitatory neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, where the exacerbated or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors starts a cascade of neurotoxicity that ultimately leads to the loss of neuronal function and cell death. This causes nerve damage in the fingers/face etc (loss of sensation, burning). 

Im not here to promote Pregablin use as it has a host of its own horrible withdrawals (similar to benzos), but just wanted to share some friendly advice and possibly a helping aid for those struggling to taper.

I am not advising to switch from one dependency to another, nor am I advising anyone to abuse and take Pregablin daily. 

EDIT: Same applies to Gabapentin.","benzorecovery",114,"https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/vx8v1k/pregablin_is_not_a_gaba_agonist/"
"791","2022-08-05",1659730036,"A doctor referred me to a fibro specialist clinic and mentioned graded exercise therapy and now Im worried","Im in the UK, specifically Scotland and this appointment wasnt even for my pain it was to get a fit for work note so the government doesnt pressure me to look for a job (which thankfully I got and everything mostly went well).She asked if I got any help at all for fibro and I told her not without paying for a rheumatologist because fibro patients in my health board dont get one anymore. She said that was correct but told me a clinic is opening back up again in my area and could refer me which would greatly help when I apply for disability again. 

What she then mentioned was graded exercise therapy and that they would probably offer that to me. And I know its scary being in pain and hearing exercise  Yeah you dont know the half of it, I know exactly how scary that horrible therapy is. 

This appointment otherwise went so well and it was completely soured by this. I barely slept last night worrying about it and she didnt tell me the name of the place and she was really nice and helpful but I am utterly terrified. Ive heard horror stories of patients being forced to run on a treadmill for 40 minutes and breaking down into tears. 

Even just getting to an in person appointment for ANYTHING is painful and stressful for me. Life is utter hell without a car, I can barely walk around my apartment as I also have sciatica and its bad and no doctor is taking it seriously. Im also autistic with adhd and travelling anywhere is extremely stressful for me because of all of the sensory issues I have. 

She also referred me to a holistic outpatient place that has massage therapies, group therapy and art therapy which sounds like something that would be a LOT more soothing and helpful to me. 

Im already terrified of people and have trauma, I dont want to go through someone shouting at me (not literally a lot of people just talk VERY loud) to try harder and making me cry. Im a 21 year old woman but barely feel like a person, its humiliating. 

This doctor meant well and wants to help me but Im absolutely appalled and terrified that these NHS specialists are still using such outdated and harmful treatment especially since she also mentioned not liking the fact that I was on pregabalin or painkillers when I cant walk without them. 

I really hope they can offer me water/hydrotherapy or something that is gentle and soothing. Stress makes my medication ineffective and causes garbage sleep and horrific flares, I seriously cant handle it. 

Im also scared that theyll send me home with homework or do this every single day and develop a routine and schedule  when I have adhd and even on stimulants its still not possible for me to be that consistent no matter how hard I try, and trust me I have tried my absolute hardest. 

Does she just have outdated knowledge or is the NHS actually still forcing fibro patients to go through this. She sounded fairly young, Ive never met this doctor in person before and she seemed nice enough. Im scared to refuse any treatment at any outpatient appointments because they might drop me from their list entirely which has happened when I have refused cbt for trauma.

He called it Post-Vaccine Inflammatory Disorder similar to those who have Post Covid autoimmune responses. 

Here were the symptoms:
A few days after the Moderna booster (prev had 2 pfizer and was fine), I started spitting blood when clearing my throat. Panicked thinking it was a PE I went to A&amp;E, was checked over with d dimer test and chest x ray and all was fine but my throat was extremely inflamed. 

Ended up a few weeks later having calf pain which I was tested for DVT and that came back normal. I then started experiencing sharp electric like headaches for months and neck pain which felt like someone was stabbing my head. Scared the living daylights out of me, numerous A&amp;E visits - Ive had CT angiography done on my head, MRI of the neck and all sorts and apart from a slight disc out of place in the neck everything came back completely normal. Blood tests and ECGs were also okay.

Then started to experience hot liquid sensations down my right leg and nerve pains. Very weird.
Started to feel better a few weeks ago after the doc prescribed Pregabalin, naproxen for the inflammation and omeprazole for acid reflux. Symptoms still there now Ive come off the week and a half dose but glad to have some answers. 

Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms post vac? Ive also found my BP to spike at times (usually 128/82-85 range and I can go up to 163/97 at times!) and Im so anxious/OCD which has never been an issue for me before.

Ive had a formal diagnosis from a GP of fibro for just over a year now but it wasnt really taken seriously and nothing was done about it. I bit the bullet and went private for a rheumatologist and oh my god Â£350 well spent! She actually gave me a proper appointment, a physical examination, examined my blood tests to rule out anything, she gave me treatment options and prescribed me medication! And the medication (pregabalin) works! (mostly). 

Im kinda dizzy (like the sensation of sitting in a little boat on slightly choppy water) and it can be a little frustrating but I can move a lot more now! 

Ive not been on it for very long but I noticed the effects immediately. It doesnt really help on bad days other than keeping me mostly calm which probably means I need my dosage adjusted. I hope it stays this way and it doesnt lose its effect. I made pancakes yesterday for me and my flatmates, was able to tidy up after AND organise the baking drawer. Ive not been able to do that since my first year of university (in my 4th year of study now, and Im on medical leave). I also now have a recent ADHD diagnosis Im starting medication in a few weeks. Omg to think I might actually be able to work and use my degree!

Im so glad I took time off to look after myself. The burnout from forcing myself to work through pain is slowly ebbing away, I feel like Im returning to how I used to be a few years ago (but everything in my life is a LOT less terrible) and I honestly thought that would never happen. 

I hope that if the medication keeps working and if a higher dose dulls my pain or stops most flare ups then I can do regular exercise. I want to be able to hike more with my partner in the highlands when he comes to visit me. When I go to California to see him he wants to teach me how to surf and I also want to try paddle boarding and snowboarding.

(also a bit of a rant LOL)","**\*\*PLEASE exercise caution, be safe and responsible, and keep in mind that DIFFERENT GENERICS &amp; BRAND NAMES can make a big difference!\*\***

WARNING, this is **LONG**, but hopefully worth the read.

Hi everyone,

For people who are labeled ""treatment-resistant"" like me, I thought I'd come share some things that I wished I could have found in my lowest of lows, when I felt absolutely hopeless and that I had no options left. I feel your pain. Trust me. So I want to give you the tiniest bit of hope, anything that keeps you going.

This started with my third major depressive episode which began fall of 2020 and that I am technically? still in but am trying different things and managing. It's EXTREMELY frustrating how unknowledgeable doctors seem to be these days, how backdated they are on research. And I know they're extremely busy and probably don't have time to keep up with research, but you would think they would hold some kind of seminars or something every once in a while. Most doctors will stick you with some SSRI and when that doesn't work, most are lost or completely missguided. My endless suffering and countless medication trials are what led me to research and research and research, to find SOMETHING, ANYTHING, that may relieve my suffering. But its' doctors lack of answers and help that forced me to essentially try to treat myself. And even then, it's hard to find or convince a doctor that will try some of these unconventional treatments, even though there are PUBLISHED CLINICAL STUDIES/TRIALS on them, just because they are not commonly used, and do not want to be held accountable for any possible negative consequences. The serotonin-deficiency hypothesis of depression is so outdated now, and they are realizing this. Depression is not a one-size-fits-all illness, it's very complicated, and ""treatment-resistance"" is very likely due to the fact that different people can have different imbalances other than serotonin (or norepinephrine) that are causing their depression

But if you're like me and you tried every antidepressant under the sun and you are DESPERATE, here are some possible options:

\*\*\*\***1ST AND FOREMOST,** get EXTENSIVE blood work done. Check your vitamin D levels, B12, ferritin (iron), and THYROID. Hypothyroidism, or even subclinical hypothyroidism could play a role in your nonresponse to treatment! (There is so much research out there on this, a simple google search on the link between thyroid issues, even subclinical ones, to depression will teach you so much).

anyways, OPTIONS:

1. **GABAergic drugs** (especially if you have comorbid anxiety): These are medications that work on GABA, one of the neurotransmitters in our brains (just like serotonin). Numerous studies have identified the link between depression and GABA. There are different types of GABAergic drugs &amp; there are studies done on numerous ones as treatment or adjunctive treatments for depression and/or anxiety:

* **Anticonvulsants** (also used as mood stabilizers), commonly **Lyrica (pregabalin)** or **Neurontin** **(gabapentin)** [**https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22431439/**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22431439/)
* **Baclofen** [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1345/aph.1C465](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1345/aph.1C465)
* &gt;!Benzodiazepines !&lt;(things like Xanax, Ativan, etc.) The research doesn't really support their efficacy in depression, but I can tell you that for the entire year of 2021 of trying different antidepressants and therapy for my severe depression, NOTHING made a difference except a low dose Ativan. No one believed me, no doctors believed me, but it was the ONLY thing that improved my depression and genuinely the only reason I am still alive today. It saved my life, and I may be an odd unique case but hey, you may be too. Unfortunately its effect wears off after \~6 hours, and tolerance eventually builds and it's &gt;!addictive!&lt;, so it wasn't a permanent solution but it definitely was the only thing that got me through that entire year while trying to find other options.

1. **Stimulants** &gt;!(\*abuse potential warning)!&lt; \- essentially dopaminergic drugs. There is currently only one antidepressant, Buproprion, that is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and it doesn't work for all. It didn't work for me. That doesn't mean that your depression doesn't respond to dopamine.

* **MODAFINIL** (or its sister drug, Armodafinil) - another drug that has SAVED my life.After 12 rounds of ECT, being put on Remeron, Effexor, and Lamictal, and still extremely depressed, I researched and stumbled upon this medication, which is labelled as a ""wakefulness promoting agent"" AKA a stimulant, but milder and has 'low addiction potential' according to the US FDA. It's not commonly known or prescribed I think, but there are SO many anecdotal reports as well as scientific studies dating back to 2000 &amp; possibly earlier?? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10847314/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10847314/) Here's one, there's many, and honestly if you just search ""modafinil for depression reviews"", that's what will really convince you. The best thing is that it works right away (within 1/2 to 1 hour). Some people refer to this as a ""smart drug"" and abuse it, as it does increase dopamine and is found to help with things like focus, motivation, energy, etc. I can personally vouch for this medication, I convinced my doctor to let me try it and at first I took 100 mg and felt nothing and was extremely disappointed, but my doc told me to try 200 mg and within half an hour, I finally felt the depression lift. Like magic. Unfortunately the effects usually only last an average of 4-6 hours, so you may require dosing 2x a day, but please consult with your doctor and figure it out with them. Also, they claim tolerance doesn't occur, but I was taking 200 mg for 2 months daily and unfortunately it stopped working, I even tried a higher dose. Everyone is different and for some tolerance doesn't build, but just a warning. You can try skipping one or two days a week to avoid tolerance, or going on a ""drug holiday"" (which is what I did) to reset tolerance.
* Other stimulants - most commonly prescribed for ADHD, are stronger, one of the most abused drug classes, which include medications such as Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, etc. Research has shown them to be an effective augmentation option in resistant depression [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6375494/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6375494/) . Can be hard to convince a doctor to prescribe one, but don't give up, show them clinical studies, etc.

1. **THYROID hormones -** this is one I had never heard of, and was never even MENTIONED by any of the doctors I saw. I didn't even find it while doing my research. I only discovered it because after suddenly gaining a lot of weight and having severe fatigue, I did a blood test that revealed I had subclinical hypothyroidism. \*\*KEEP IN MIND I HAD DONE THE SAME BLOOD TEST NOT EVEN A YEAR AGO AND IT SHOWED THAT MY THYROID LEVELS WERE FINE, SO YOU LITERALLY NEVER KNOW. DO REPEAT BLOOD TESTS, LAB ERRORS OCCUR, YOU NEVER KNOW.\*\* anyways even if you don't have any thyroid issues, apparently thyroid hormone is a common augmentation strategy (??!!), in particular **T3 Hormone therapy.** [**https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451035/**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451035/)I'm SHOCKED that I had never heard of this, and that no doctors mention it, even though it seems to be well studied and proven effective!
2. Other random shit:

* **Pramipexole** (dopamine agonist usually prescribed for Parkinson's) [https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights/pramipexole-treatment-resistant-depression/](https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights/pramipexole-treatment-resistant-depression/)
* Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as **Celecoxib** [**https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19496103/**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19496103/)
* Mood stabilizers - I know I already technically mentioned a few, but there are others with different mechanisms of action and have been proven very effective such as **Lamictal (lamotrigine)** and **Lithium**

1. **CLINICAL TRIALS** [https://clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) \- You can literally sign up for any trial in the world, just type in the condition and country, there are so many new innovative and promising ones being done especially in the U.S., and since there's so many there is hopefully one that you are eligible for. In particular the **Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression** trial results are SO amazing and give me so much hope. [https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/10/depression-treatment.html](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/10/depression-treatment.html) An article on the first study that was done I think, IT WAS 80% EFFECTIVE AND BROUGHT RAPID REMISSION! That's freaking amazing. I know they are in the middle of doing a bunch more trials on this, and I believe there may be one(s) that are actively recruiting.

`IN CONCLUSION, SO SORRY THIS WAS SO LONG BUT IF YOU READ IT ALL I REALLY REALLY HOPE THIS PROVIDED SOME POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR YOU AND GAVE YOU SOME HOPE. PLEASE PLEASE NEVER GIVE UP. DEPRESSION IS SOUL CRUSHING. BUT THERE IS A TREATMENT FOR YOU OUT THERE! ***Also please keep in mind that just because one medication within a drug class (such as stimulants) didn't work for you, that DOES NOT mean another one won't, even if your doctor says so! PLEASE ADVOCATE for yourself and don't let anyone discourage you. WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS. WE WILL FIND WHAT WORKS FOR US.

For me it is an initial dosage of 2ml in a glass of orange juice and then dose 1ml / 1.5ml every hour and a half drinking it as if it were a drink, always remaining under the maximum dosage of 8ml. 

Then excellent sensation mix it in smaller doses of about 1ml with stimulants, this increases euphoria and decreases vasoconstriction and muscle tension. A really good substance when used responsibly. 

I recommend starting with a dose of 1ml and seeing what effects it produces before pushing the doses, with this substance in particular more does not mean better.

"901","2022-03-06",1646608022,"You need to know the dangers of ""safe"" gabapentinoids!!!!","I was well managed on 10mg percocet QID for 16 months. But my doctor was worried about covering his *ass* more than he was about my quality of life, so he wanted to switch me to something ""much safer""....gabapentin/pregabalin. And because all I really want is pain relief, I agreed. But even when I told him it paled in comparison to the relief from the percs, to the point I could no longer work, play with my children, have sex with my husband, drive or even be a passenger in a car for more than 15min, or even BATHE myself without a nurse to help me, he STILL refused to take me off of it!


It started gradually, but I started to faint. I mean full on loss of consciousness and passing out kind of fainting. It was because of long qtc. My heart was waiting so long in between beats that my BP was dropping so low that I passed out. It took 4 years and 6 doctors to figure out that it was the gabapentin!!! So by that time it was permanent!!! Switching to pregabalin helped for awhile, but as soon as it built up in my system, it's started getting severe again. I've been off of it for 6 months and I am still plagued with this, although the severity and frequency has improved a lot. The worst is when it's just enough to confuse me. I just space out and lose my vision. It's embarrassing when trying to hold a conversation, but it's absolutely terrifying if it happens while I I'm driving or crossing a street!!!


Gabapentin also gave me dry mouth SO BAD that I lost ALL but TWO of my molars, and my bi-cuspids and incisors are all broken or have cavities. My gums receded so far back that every single tooth needed to be drilled out and filled. And this was despite dry mouth lozenges/mouth washes, brushing 2x daily, and drinking in excess of 120 oz of water daily!!! Because you know, the docs only advice was to ""stay hydrated""!!!

And my God I did not realize how bad the brain fog was until I stopped taking it. I struggled to do BASIC addition and had to use paper and a calculator. I couldn't hold a thought and definitely not a conversation. I can't remember ANYTHING from the past 5 years. I experienced it, but NONE of it was committed to memory.  I said and did things that made ZERO sense!!!


And this was supposed to be sooooo much safer than percocet???? Even after being on it for 16 months I experienced NO WITHDRAWAL. So dependence wasn't even a concern!! Not to mention, that if it was, and God willing the day came when I didn't need it anymore, I could he weaned me off and given medications to make WD more than comfortable.


When this happened to me, I found a ton of gabapentinoid support groups and heard all kinds of horror stories!!! Tons of different, PERMANENT heart conditions. Others had neurological conditions to the point of losing most of their function and having terrible, intractable pain!!! Also PERMANENT!!!


I know these drugs are the go to opioid *""safe""* alternative. They tell you NONE of the risks involved!!! Supposedly they have ""low risk"" of long qtc. However, if they trialed 1000 people, and only 8 of them got it, and they ""explained it away""  by some other ""condition"", then they aren't even required to list it as a side effect. They did however, find that it caused long qtc in EVERY rabbit they tested it on, and it got exponentially worse with each passing dose (at minimum dose) and that went up drastically with increasing the dose. Well, i guess some of us are part bunny! Or, more than likely, they fudged the damn numbers!!!


If you guys are on this medication and experiencing abnormal heart beats/  rhythms, fainting, confusion, black spots in your vision, tremors, abnormal body movements, dropping everything, or a change in your pain or worsening of your condition.....it is probably the gaba! And if your doc says that ""isn't possible"" get a second, third, fourth or SIXTH opinion until you find one willing to listen to you. Please dont be naive and stupid like I was!!!

(I urge you to read the comments for further conditions/side effects)

EDIT: (I can't believe I forgot to mention this in my op) the withdrawal was AWWWWFFUUUULLL! Constant restless BODY syndrome, completely unable to sleep, the chills and sweats and chills and sweat, my eyes and nose running non stop....omfg. Tapering did help a lot, I got to one 300mg pill every 48hrs, and even then I had withdrawal symptoms but the kratom took care of most of them.

2nd EDIT: I feel like I need to make something clearer. I am not saying that gabapentin and pregabalin have no therapeutic use or that these conditions will absolutely happen to you if you take them. I get the sense that pregabalin causes less side effects and has a decently high success rate.

If these medications help you, I am incredibly grateful! I'm part of this community because I deal with debilitating pain too, and I am ecstatic to hear one of you say you found a treatment that works!

My purpose here, was that the docs gave this to me with NO WARNING when CLEARLY many, many people have suffered severe side effects and permanent heart and neurological conditions. If the docs won't tell you, SOMEONE SHOULD! Like I said in the OP: if you * have experienced any of these* please talk to you doctor and consider cessation. *If you have not* then you are probably fine. If you have been on it for years, there is a good chance you may have developed dependency. So, in other words: USE WITH CAUTION.","ChronicPain",105,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/t8b05y/you_need_to_know_the_dangers_of_safe/"

The activation of Mu-Opioid receptors in Hedonic Hotspots is actually the mechanism behind feeling pleasure (when doing pleasurable things) and that has been proved in recent studies. Dopamine is responsible for Motivation. For more information you can look [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425246/#:~:text=Liking%2C%20or%20pleasure%20itself%2C%20is,generators%20for%20desire%20versus%20dread).

The reason medications such as Adderall, which work on Dopamine receptors, cause pleasure is because they also work on Opioid receptors. The activation of Gaba receptors in Hedonic Hotspots also causes pleasure. That's why medication such as Pregabalin helps people. However, Drugs that work on these receptors probably down-regulates them long-term. Its a better idea to figure out what happened in the brain to cause the dysfunction of the reward system and fix that. Maybe thats impossible to do or fix. Who knows.

Also the activation of Kappa-Opioid receptors in certain parts of the brain are inhibitory towards Mu-Opioid Receptors, so decreasing that would probably help too. Its also obvious that the activation of certain Serotonin receptors messes with the reward system in someway. That is evident from the fact that people who take SSRIS have increased Anhedonia.

edit: the pleasure system is very complex and I dont have all the answers. Im still researching.

edit: all im saying is that dopamine receptors isn't responsible for pleasure its more to do with opioid system in hedonic hotspots i dont have all the answers idk a lot of things idk why reddit is stressing me out so much im just gonna log out of this account and not ocme back and research more peace","anhedonia",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/w8klhc/can_i_clear_up_a_rumor/"
"931","2022-08-25",1661428706,"Back Pain Hell and How DMT Interacted With It","It's going to be a long post, so bear with me :) Since this is also a medical thing, I need to tell you guys what had happened before the dmt trip. This happened few months ago. 

At the end of March, I went to my father's friend, physiotherapist because of some (not severe) lower back pain which had been going on for two months. Since I had already known that I had hernia on two discs on my lower back, I thought that it was related to that. The pain had been on and off. I was generally feeling it when I walked like 20+ minutes.

He checked some stuff, listened what had been the problem and prescribed few minor drugs telling that it's probably related to the hernia. No need for MRI.

Like three days after that, I tried some stretching for back pain watching a very simple yoga instruction video. They were literally the simplest moves I could do. Few minutes after I started doing them, an insanely sharp pain shot through my back. It felt like somebody was ripping my nerves off or something. 10-15 minutes later I just knew I was fucked. I couldn't even breath without feeling that excruciating pain each second. I have experience with hernia pain (on my neck) and this was nothing like it. I guess my nerves (or muscles?) got fucked up or something. There were few times in my life that I felt that miserable since I didn't know what the fuck I was going to do, couldn't stand up or sit properly. Walking was a fucking torture.

I forced myself to to ER which is close to my apartment. People in the hospital were literally watching me and trying to understand what the fuck is wrong with me since my face was doing weird mimics and I was groaning. Got an IM shot (muscle relaxer + pain reliever) and the doctor who was with me there prescribed me IM shots for like 6-7 days. On the system, he wrote ''fibromyalgia'' for that ER visit.

So I started getting IM shots, but I also went to another doctor in another hospital to get a second opinion. She ordered an MRI, got the result, it was clean, so definitely not hernia.She considered my condition as muscle spasms and prescribed some stuff according to that. Took a week off from works after that visit.

Here I was, not knowing what the fuck  was happening to me, getting IM shots left and right, all I could think of was ''pain''. I was trying to do anything I can to somehow be little bit more comfortable resting at home, muscle relaxer, pain reliever, weed, pregabaline, some nights ketamine... 

Few weeks later I almost got back to my normal self. I thought whatever happened must have healed somehow since I was very careful with my moves, how much I rested etc 

Finally I was relieved and felt hopeful. I felt like I can start my usual fitness routine. I had been craving for basketball for a long time, but just as I was finally starting to play again, all this shit had happened. Since I was finally feeling ok to play, I decided to play with my coworkers one Sunday. 

Half way through the first match, my back started getting little bit tense. At the end of second match, a consistent pain had developed and I knew for the second time, I fucked up big time. By the way, this pain was also different from the one that happened at home during stretching. I was cursing myself all the way to home. ''I've just felt normal, why the fuck did I play basketball!'' I started panicking at home because the pain was different, it was just constant, annoying as fuck. I got so fed up with all this back situation, I didn't even want to think about doctors, tests, hospitals etc. I immediately took 300mg pregabaline. Smoked some weed. I also did edible and a muscle relaxer, but the pain was there mocking me with each effort of getting rid of it. 

I was lying on my wife's lap (very soothing for me haha) when I suddenly thought about dmt. I had just prepared 0.5g + 0.5ml PG few days ago. I thought I might as well smoke it. 

I began feeling the effects. I tried to keep myself in the same zone by smoking every 5-7 minutes, effects are not even sub-breakthrough like this, more like micro doses. Well, I was not expecting my pain to magically go away with dmt of course, but I was also not expecting what comes with it. Pain, all I was thinking was pain, I kind of felt that dmt was literally making me face with the pain. All I was thinking, feeling, understanding become pain. Pain encompassed me. And in one second, I had the urge to go to bed and lie down taking the vape with me. I had no idea why, but I listened to this instinct.

I went to bedroom and lied down in the dark, still vaping every few minutes. And then, something started communicating with me in a very clear tone telling me that the pain I was feeling is just a matter of perspective. I was just thinking about what this communication meant that the pain stopped instantly. I was incredibly confused but I just let it go. Then the pain started like it never left. And then gone and started... 

''See? Perspective..''

I got really excited with this telepathic communication since I still couldn't believe that with micro dose I had this connection somehow. After some time, I suddenly understood that I was not getting high from the vaporizer. It was dark, so I thought it got clogged or something, went to the kitchen to check it. Drew few times without inhaling just to see if it was working. Weirdly, nothing was wrong with the vape. Went back to bed, still dark. Started inhaling and trying to get my dose so that I could continue having this interesting communication. After 1 or 2 failed attempts, I heard/felt it again, this was way more clear than the first time:

''Stop doing it! You don't need to do it anymore. As for pain, do not worry...''

I was shocked how clear the message was. I stood up and went back to living room, sat next to my wife. No pain, no discomfort, no negative thoughts, no misery, not one negative thought. I was nearly crying from happiness and I was in disbelief at the same time. 

I thought about sharing this in this sub immediately but  I wanted to see my progress first, physically I mean. Here I am, after months passed, I'm playing basketball 4-5 times a week and working out at home at least 4 times a week. I'm 36 and it's the first time in my life that I'm this active and fit. 

This is not of course a ''dmt fixed my ...'' post, but nonetheless I thing it's a very interesting experience. After that, each time I vaped dmt like that I felt that presence of communication btw, it's stil there, I'm just not finding reasons to do dmt right now. I'm sorry if this is so unnecessarily long for you but I really thought stuff that lead to trip is important. What I give importance here is not really how my back pain was fixed somehow, but that clear communication I had.","DMT",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/wxca4y/back_pain_hell_and_how_dmt_interacted_with_it/"
"941","2022-01-21",1642761941,"My experience with sciatica, 2.5 month journey","Warning - long post.
tl;dr 29F, sciatica since 2.5 months, reduced pain level from 4/10 to 1/10

Beginning of sciatica  - 29F, quite active, I workout regularly, and have been lifting weights since 5 years. 
Currently, working from home.

End of September 2021, I felt a weird pain in my lower back after doing too many burpees. Something about this pain felt different, though I didn't have sciatica then, I knew I had to stop working out, something didn't feel right.

So, I continued taking walks, and stopped lifting weights and HIIT workouts. In the beginning of November, one fine morning, just after my walk, I felt some pain in my right glutes, which kind of radiated to my calf muscles. My pain levels were a constant 4/10, it worsened by sitting long periods of time. 


MRI and medication - I went to a spine surgeon and got my MRI on November 2nd week. My MRI shows bulging L5/S1 disc. I was prescribed pregabalin for pain management. This helped me sleep peacefully. Working from home meant I could take as many breaks I want, but sitting through hour long meetings was a pain in the ass!! Quite literally!!


Journey - So, after 2 weeks of being in constant pain through the day, I started taking short walks, day 1, I could only walk for 5 mins, before I was in pain, I couldn't continue. Everyday I aimed to take 3-4 short walks, each day slightly longer than than the previous. I kept educating myself, reading about sciatica, but was scared to tryout any exercises or follow any advice on the internet, just for the fear of making it worse.

At one month mark, I was able to walk for 20-25 mins, without increasing my pain levels. I visited my doctor again, who was so understanding, and gave me some serious hopes!! My pregabalin dosage was reduced.
He suggested I start with excercises like baby cobra, cat camel, side plank, bird dog, planks.


At 2 month mark, I was able to walk 30-40 mins, at a much higher pace, completed around 6-7k steps a day. Exercised regularly, included suggested exercises, and slight variations to them. My pain levels were now at 2 or 3.

At 2.5 month mark, I have now increased my step count to 10-12k per day. My pain levels are at 1/10, just yesterday I was able to sit through a 2hr meeting, without much discomfort. I am relieved, and just hoping to win the battle against sciatica.


Things that really helped me- 

Hot water bag - I use this whenever I feel any discomfort, and I get immediate relief. I even sleep with it under my lower back, and reheat it anytime I wake up during the night. It helps me, I have a slightly less pain when I wake up in the morning.

Baby cobra position - I can't thank you guys enough, I found about McKenzie pressups here. I hang out in this position for a while, watch a youtube video or something, it eliminates my pain after a while.

Plank, side plank, cat camel, bird dog - I have been timing my planks, I have gone from less than 10 sec to 45 secs. This progress gives me a lot of hope.

Short walks - I walk around, short 5-10 mins walk, through out the day. I can't stress enough, how much this has helped me.

Really supportive spouse and family - there are no words, I just love love love them, for sticking with me, through everything.

The day I found this sub, I decided I would make a post when I felt better. So here it is!! All the things that I mentioned here are just what helped me, this is not a advice, it might or might not work for you. 

Any suggestions, questions are welcome!!","Sciatica",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/s981ly/my_experience_with_sciatica_25_month_journey/"
"951","2022-05-03",1651592181,"My Doctors are giving up on me","Im 24F and started having reflux at 12, so for half my life now I have suffered with acid symptoms and been medicated. 

Theyve done every test: swallow study, 24 hour PH studies, barium X-ray, blood tests& nothing has shown enough to prove why Im having the symptoms I get. My main problem is the heart burn, its almost constant and if I dont medicate then its unbearable. I taste it in my mouth all the time, especially of a night, my dentist recently told me that if I dont sort it soon then I will loose teeth/have further damage (I have already lost one and theyre stripped of enamel).

Ive gone through dozens of medications and they all stop working eventually, Im currently taking Rabeprazole (morning/evening), Gaviscon Advance (a few swigs, mostly before bedtime) and the odd esomeprazole when really bad. I avoid all triggers: caffeine, sugar, rich buttery foods and carbonated drinks, I mostly sleep sitting up. I try not to eat too late in the evening and whenever I take medication I always made sure theres something in my stomach first. 

Additional to all this I also have severe endometriosis, Interstitial Cystitis and anxiety/depression. I take fluoxetine, buscopan, pregabalin, buscopane and when my endo is flaring severely I am prescribed oral morphine (all reflux symptoms began long before I regularly started consuming these meds).

My latest appointment today was with a gastroenterologist who obviously couldnt have cared less, he didnt even know what I was there for. I explained my history and he made sarcastic remarks and questioned everything I said, for example I told him I had endometriosis and he began grilling me about how I was diagnosed and my treatment (I had a five hour excision surgery last July!) then finished with but do you really have it though?& it was humiliating. 

I asked if my endo could have anything to do with it and he just shrugged, he said they had done every test and they were all within the appropriate margins and there wasnt much more they could do for me. I told him I couldnt continue like this and he agreed to prescribe me domperidone with the possibility of it being slow digestion. Ive had these before and they did nothing. 

I dont know what to do! Im stuck and worried and scared it will be like this forever. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or similar experiences?

I'm currently addicted to Xanax, Pregabalin, Zopiclone, Morphine, Diazepam and Codeine.

I also take medication for my schizophrenia. In total I take about 24 tablets a day which are prescribed,  these are: 1 Zopiclone 7.5mg, Codeine phosphate 8x 30mg, Chlorpromazine 7x 100mg, Mirtazapine 45mg and more. I also occasionally use Cocaine which is dangerous anyway let alone when you're taking massive amounts of illegal prescription drugs.

I'm prescribed 164 tablets a week but when I buy my drugs off the dark net markets I'll easily take about 400 pills a week. 

The problem isn't that I'm taking illegal prescription drugs, the problem is that I'm taking them with my prescribed meds which my doctor informed me was extremely dangerous, especially the morphine and xanax.

I'm terrified I won't wake up one day but it still isn't enough to make me quit, addiction is a very powerful thing. I also drink about a litre of vodka every 2 days, either that or 1.4 litres of disaronno.

"981","2022-12-01",1669858609,"Thank You guys. This sub made me realise the way I treated my problems sucked","Obligatory English is not my first language disclaimar.

It isn't depression, it's despair at the state of the World. All the things that made me feel shitty They're real and my reaction was totally valid. I was always very sensitive child (got diagnosed with autism and adhd later), got bullied for it and generally didn't cope. I was on SSRI and later SNRI close to half my life (I'm 20 started when I was 10, though tgere were breaks in between). They didn't made me feel better, more like numb.

I also got on different meds to help my with anxiety (I simply couldn't fall asleep for a longest time - still have troubles with it), but the only one I remember is the one I took for last 2 years, which was pregabalin. It actually worked like intended, except no one mentioned possible side effects, or the fact that it's main purpose is treating epilepsy. I only learned that after I wanted to smoke some weed and decided to google if mixing them could be dangerous.

I was also on ritalin for a few months. I hoped it will help me with my trouble with keeping focus - than I learned it doesn't help with focus, but with hyperactivity. But my hyperactivity was manageable, keeping focus was the problem. But apparently in my country they ALWAYS start with ritalin, and only switch to the other drug (don't remember name) that actually helps with focus if it fails. But like how the fact was it suppose to help? So it actually made me even less able to focus since I was tired all the time (since that's how you deal with hyperactivity).

Anyway I was kinda planning to quit it (I already spent some time on this sub), and then one day I just forgot to take it, which made me feel like shit, but I just decided ""fuck it, let's do it"" and went cold turkey. I had a few days of intense muscle pain and cold sweats, but I managed.

Somewhere around this time (don't remember before or after) I googled pregabalin and learned side effectes. One of them is problems with eye vision. Eyesight in my right eye has been worsening since I started taking it (although I only noticed in hindsight) - not drastically, but noticeable. Basicly I had problems with eyes but I was able to keep it (basically my eye muscle were able to compensate so I wans't feeling effects). And then they weren't. So I decided I needed to quit, so after the effect of ritalin withdrawal passed I quit them cold turkey too.

Supprise it actually kinda hepled my ability to focus, since I wasn't in an antipepressant daze.

But people put insane amout of trust in psychiatry and psychology. My mother managed my therapy for most of my life (obviously, since I was a child). She is a medical doctor (not in psychiatry though) My first therapist was someone her friend recommended. Second was recomended by first. They kinda felt fishy a few times, but I convinced myself I'm overreacting.

Then yo and behold we went to psychiatrist to try to get me new meds, and she asked where I go to therapy to check it out. Turns out, the first one (the one she googled) could only be found in a ""Christian psychologists"" group and didn't finish psychology. We didn't check the second, but I bet he was the same. I since found therapist that actually is licenced (and specialises in autistic adults, so that's good for me), but I spended I think somethinf like 4 years with those guys.

Also funny story about how I switched from SSRI to SNRI. Mum was on some sort of medical panel, and there was psychiartist speaking. She talked to him afterwards and described my situation, he asked her a couple of questions (one being whether I like sweets) and recomended I switch SSRI to SNRI and to switch pregabalin to something else. I think SNRI did improve my mentals state (at least innitially), though the pregabalin replacement made me basically faint after taking it, so I refused.

Funny part is that in hindsight it might have been better than ANTI EPILEPTIC drug, since I literaly used it to be able to sleep, but my mom insisted I take it when she wanted (which was something like 2 hours before I wanted to actually go to sleep) which made me unable to function when I still wanted, so I refused to switch that one.

But like... the guy who never seen me in person felt confident to suggest drugs to me after what I assume was like 15 minute conversation with my mother. And she trusted him. And while what he suggested wasn't that bad... he probably could have suggested anything. Including antipsychotics or other really dangearous stuff. And she would have believed him. It makes my skin crawl.

Anyway thank You all. Being able to actually experience emotions is nice, if not always pleasant, and understanding that I'm not a problem helps too. So thanks again everyone

Look. Ill preface it like this. Absolutely psychedelics will bring you closer to god than any other substance can. It will dissolve you ego and self and dissolve the dissolution that you are your own self but rather a single part of an entire consciousness. 

DMT Ill add in its own place because it will Preface my next chapter opiates. DMT is a place that when you go to you feel that youve been there before. Theres something familiar about this place and its a shared feeling amongst many of us. 

Opiates will bring you closer to the physical feeling of death and dying and the calmness that persist beyond. The moments of consciousness instantly followed by moments of dream like unconsciousness. Not to be confused with the death or rebirth realm of dmt. But rather a physical realm of death 

Dissos will always be the intermediate period of reality and what I call knock knock knocking on death doors. For all of us whove truly experienced a kHole we can relate being this floating head in the vastness of space with nothing but our own mind and the absolute darkness of nothingness and its just us. Our mind and that vastness because we are completely disconnected from it all 

However 

Intramuscular injection of 

FXE 

Combines the bliss and euphoria of everything I just mentioned above together. I felt as if I have entered heaven and nothing was to bother me ever again. 

There was a sense of psychedelia as I felt a closeness to source while under the disso effect of the experience. I cannot say I actually detached from my body I was still apart of it although I didnt have much use for it. My eyes where completely aware at what I was looking at but I was just floating 

The euphoria compared that to some of my best fentanyl trips. However, the desire to want to use again was not there. There was nothing fiendish about it. It just was bliss, a bliss that I chased opiates for years never to attain but somehow attained while under the influence of this FXE 

DMT and this. DMT is another realm.  Another reality. This was here and now. I was present and I was aware. Thats what made this trip so comforting. 

Dissos. I dont have much experience with disso beyond a load of ketamine from all over the world. Different isomers, and kinds even Pakistani preset (the ketamine HCL before it goes into saline solutions) plus PCP 

I didnt like ketamine except for the two times I IMed it.  Or rather a friend IMed me.  I also loved ketamine as a spiced drug in top of lsd and other drugs or my coke down drug. The experience was different. Ketamine was rather more disassociation while also bliss. FXE was complete heaven.  I thought I floated off into heaven and that was that. I was listening to shpongle, I wonder why, but I was just there. It wasnt long maybe 30 minutes in total 15 minutes of the peak. It also took about 10-15 minutes to kick in.  But that peak was by far the most heavenly feel that I ever came across. 

There was introspection, examination, exploration, but best of all. I was able to just shut everything up and enjoy my ride and thats what made IM FXE the greatness that it was 


10-15 minutes I started to taste it in my mouth and thats when i knew it was about to hit. For 10 minutes I sat and thought I didnt do enough 

15minutrs was pure peak 

30 minutes was coming back.

EDIT:

I IMEd a 2nd time with a dose closer to 150mg. 
Takes about 15 minutes to kick in so I did a few things put on a random plaulylist where it played some of the most classic dubstep songs I havent heard in years and I wondered why on earth would it play these songs out of all songs

Anyways the second trip I completely lost touch with reality. I was absolutely gone and the only thing that held me tethered to my own life was the music I was playing. 

At one point I believe my family tried talking to me and I answered them but I do not know if this really happened 

I was gone for much longer atleast 30-45 minutes where I couldnt move. When I finally came back it took 30 minutes to shake off the feeling entirely 

I was left with a terrible after feeling. Like a bodily tingling I cannot describe but it was extremely uncomfortable. I took 300mg of Pregabalin and a vallium and etizolam and it still didnt really help 
  Eventually I took ghb and it over powered this feeling and I ended up passing out 

I think its an amazing molecule to experement with maybe at lower dosages. Maybe once in a blue moon. But I am never going to binge IM or do it multiple time in one day. Even looking back I had a very slight hangover effect from the first time I didnt quite recognize untill I did my second dose.","researchchemicals",72,"https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/zkk6t6/fxe_im_probably_the_most_euphoric_and_godly_state/"
